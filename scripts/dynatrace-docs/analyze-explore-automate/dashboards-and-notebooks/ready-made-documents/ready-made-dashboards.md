* Published Jul 08, 2022

Dynatrace ready-made dashboards offer preconfigured data visualizations and filters designed for common scenarios like troubleshooting and optimization.

* Use them right out of the box
* Save a copy and customize your copy

Where to find ready-made dashboards

1. In Dynatrace, go to ![Dashboards](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-512-b1f1e9690b.png "Dashboards") **Dashboards**.
2. Choose a way to list all ready-made dashboards.

   ![Dashboards: Select "Ready-made" tab](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-select-ready-made-tab-469-5224ee5ca2.png)

   ![Select "Ready-made dashboards" under list of recent dashboards](https://dt-cdn.net/images/ready-made-dashboards-button-under-recent-dashboards-263-a29f7fe076.png)
3. Select the ready-made dashboard you want to use.  
   Try the **Explore in Playground** links below to see them in action.

Using read-only dashboards

When you open a document (dashboard or notebook) for which you don't have write permission, you can still edit the document during your session. After you're finished, you have two options:

* Save your changes to a new document
* Discard your changes

Example:

1. Go to ![Dashboards](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-512-b1f1e9690b.png "Dashboards") **Dashboards**, list the ready-made dashboards, and select the **Getting started** dashboard.

   It says  **Ready-made** in the upper-left corner, next to the document name.
2. Select the Pie chart tile and then select  **Edit**.
3. Change the visualization from Pie to Donut.

   Now you are offered two buttons: **Save as new** and **Discard changes**.
4. Use the updated dashboard as needed. You have full edit access for this session.
5. When you're finished, select what to do with your changes:

   * **Save as new**âsaves your changes in a new copy of the edited dashboard.
   * **Discard changes**âdiscards your changes and returns you to the unedited read-only dashboard.

## ActiveGate diagnostic overview

Offers a filterable diagnostic overview of ActiveGate with sections for:

* **Host vitals**âHealth metrics regarding host or container where ActiveGate is running.
* **Process**âHealth metrics regarding ActiveGate Java process.
* **Networking**âIncoming and outgoing network traffic.
* **REST.API**âAPI calls, errors, request size, and response size.
