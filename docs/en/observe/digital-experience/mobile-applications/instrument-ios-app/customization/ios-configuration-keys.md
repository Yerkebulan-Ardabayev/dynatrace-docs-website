Configuration keys are essentially properties you can set to your preferences for auto-instrumentation. Add the keys to your app's [`Info.plist` file](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/info-plist-file "Info.plist file stores your app identification and configuration keys. Use it to fine-tune the instrumentation configuration."), as required to fine-tune auto-instrumentation.

The following tables include all configuration keys for iOS auto-instrumentation.
