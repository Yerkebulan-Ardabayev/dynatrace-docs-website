Dynatrace generates names for most user actions automatically. You can define user action naming rules to change the automatically generated names to a predefined name.

To create a user action naming rule

1. Go to **Frontend**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. Select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit** in the upper-right corner of the tile with your application name.
4. From the application settings, select **Naming Rules**.
5. Expand the **x action naming rules** section, and then select **Add naming rule**.
6. Enter the **Resulting user action name** and specify the naming rule conditions.
