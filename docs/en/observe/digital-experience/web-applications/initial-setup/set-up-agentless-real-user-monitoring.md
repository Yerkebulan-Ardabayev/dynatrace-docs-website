Agentless Real User Monitoring is designed to be used when you don't have access to your web server (and therefore can't install OneAgent), but when you have access to your application code.

The full benefits of Real User Monitoring can be obtained only after you've installed Dynatrace OneAgent. See [OneAgent installation is recommended](#oneagent-is-better) for more details.

## Prerequisites

Here's what you'll need to set up agentless Real User Monitoring:

* Access to your application's HTML source so that you can insert the RUM JavaScript
* RUM JavaScriptâa custom JavaScript tag, code, or snippet generated by Dynatrace

## Set up agentless monitoring

Perform the following actions to set up agentless monitoring.

[![Step 1](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-1-086e22066c.svg "Step 1")

**Create an application and insert RUM JavaScript**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/set-up-agentless-real-user-monitoring#saas-create-app-add-code "Set up agentless monitoring for your web applications.")[![Step 2 optional](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dotted-step-2-8ae6982454.svg "Step 2 optional")

**Choose another RUM JavaScript snippet format**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/set-up-agentless-real-user-monitoring#saas-choose-insertion-format "Set up agentless monitoring for your web applications.")[![Step 3](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-3-350cf6c19a.svg "Step 3")

**Keep RUM JavaScript up-to-date**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/set-up-agentless-real-user-monitoring#saas-keep-code-updated "Set up agentless monitoring for your web applications.")

### Step 1 Create an application and insert RUM JavaScript

1. In Dynatrace Hub, select **Web application monitoring via manual insertion**.
2. Select **Set up**.

3. Enter your application name and select **Add web application**. A custom JavaScript code snippet is generated for your application.
4. Select **Copy code snippet** to copy the generated JavaScript code to the clipboard. The code generated after you've created the application is in the [JavaScript tag](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats#js-tag "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case") format.

   Dynatrace offers several snippet formats of the RUM JavaScript. If youâre considering using a different snippet format, refer to the next step for guidance.
5. Paste the JavaScript code snippet into the `<head>` element of all of HTML pages that you want to monitor in your application. Ensure that the RUM JavaScript is the first executable script on each page.

   For many websites, it's possible to add custom JavaScript to all pages at once by inserting the code to be reused into a centralized `header.html` file. If possible, use this file to insert the RUM JavaScript to avoid unnecessary work.

The following example shows the code for a simple page before and after RUM JavaScript insertion.

Before injection

After injection

```
<html>



<head>



<title>MyApp</title>



<script type="text/javascript" src="myapp.js"></script>



</head>



<body>



<form>



Username: <input type="text name="username"/><br/>



Password: <input type="password" name="password"/><br/>



<input type="submit" value="Login">



</form>
```

```
<html>



<head>



<title>MyApp</title>



<script type="text/javascript" src="https://js-cdn.dynatrace.com/jstag/145e12d594f/cg36988wxq/477g8ec68708x5c1_complete.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>



<script type="text/javascript" src="myapp.js"></script>



</head>



<body>



<form>



Username: <input type="text name="username"/><br/>



Password: <input type="password" name="password"/><br/>



<input type="submit" value="Login">



</form>
```

If you already have an application that's set up for agentless monitoring, select **Applications currently set up for agentless monitoring** in step 3 of the instructions above instead of entering your application name. You can then view the list of applications already set up for agentless monitoring and their corresponding JavaScript tags, codes, or snippets. This is useful when you've already added the RUM JavaScript to some of your pages and want to extend monitoring visibility to other pages.

### Step 2 optional Choose another RUM JavaScript snippet format Optional

While the JavaScript tag format is the ideal choice for the majority of use cases, Dynatrace offers several snippet formats of the RUM JavaScript to meet a variety of requirements. Select the format that fits your application best and meets your requirements. For detailed descriptions of all formats, see [Select a snippet format](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case").

To get a different snippet format of the RUM JavaScript

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **Injection** > **Manual insertion**.
5. Choose the required snippet format, then select **Copy** to copy it to the clipboard.

### Step 3 Keep RUM JavaScript up-to-date

If you want the RUM JavaScript to be updated automatically, choose the [JavaScript tag snippet format](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats#js-tag "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case"). For other snippet formats, you need to manually update the RUM JavaScript.

Dynatrace offers a REST API that allows you to retrieve the latest RUM JavaScript for your application. You can automatically inject the latest RUM JavaScript during the build time of your application. To learn how to use the API, see [RUM manual insertion tags API](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/rum-manual-insertion-tags "Learn how you can download the RUM manual insertion tags via API").

## Things to consider

### OneAgent installation is recommended

Installation of Dynatrace OneAgent is preferable to agentless monitoring for the following reasons:

* With agentless monitoring, you need to manually insert the RUM JavaScript into each of your application's pages, which might be challenging. Dynatrace OneAgent handles the insertion of the RUM JavaScript for you.
* Unless you use the **JavaScript tag** [snippet format](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats#js-tag "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case") for agentless monitoring, the RUM JavaScript embedded into your application's pages is not automatically updated when you change your application monitoring settings. You'll have to update the code manually.

For a list of technologies and servers that support automatic RUM JavaScript injection, see [Technology support - Real User Monitoring - Web servers and applications](/docs/ingest-from/technology-support#rum-auto-injection "Find technical details related to Dynatrace support for specific platforms and development frameworks.").

For some technologies, [automatic RUM JavaScript injection](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/rum-injection#automatic-injection "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your applications") is not supported even when you can install OneAgent. For example, while OneAgent can monitor the server side of a Heroku application, it can't inject the RUM JavaScript into the application's pages. If that's the case, manually add the RUM JavaScript to your application's pages.

### Performance impact

To minimize the impact of the RUM JavaScript on the page load time, you might want to load scripts as late as possible. Use blocking script tags to ensure that the RUM JavaScript is executed exactly where you've placed it. If you need a script to run as early as possible, the execution can't be postponed.

One way to avoid these additional blocking requests during page load is to inline the script code. The script code needs to be inlined into each document, thereby propagating the data of a single cached file into every page of your application. By combining both these approaches, you can get an inline JavaScript snippet that performs the required initialization and defers the loading of the bulky code to a second script.

### Maintenance effort

Agentless monitoring requires you to insert the RUM JavaScript by yourself, so make sure that it requires as little manual effort as possible. If you don't want to have to change your code every time your application monitoring settings change or when a new version of the RUM JavaScript is released, opt for the **JavaScript tag** [snippet format](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats#js-tag "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case").

### Standards and security policies

Certain development standards that are created to make applications more secure and faster also introduce new limitations.

For example, the [Content Security Policy (CSP) standardï»¿](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP), which was introduced to minimize the chance of becoming a victim of cross-site scripting, disallows inline JavaScript code. This means that you might need to use the **JavaScript tag** [snippet format of the RUM JavaScript](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats#js-tag "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case").

### User action to distributed trace correlation

For agentless monitoring, the ability to link user actions and [distributed traces](/docs/observe/application-observability/distributed-traces "Gain observability into highly distributed, cloud-native architectures to effectively trace and analyze transactions in real time.") depends on the technologies that your application uses.

* If your application is instrumented with OneAgent, but [Real User Monitoring is not supported for its technology](/docs/ingest-from/technology-support#rum-auto-injection "Find technical details related to Dynatrace support for specific platforms and development frameworks."), then the distributed traces captured by this OneAgent can't be linked to user actions.
* If your application issues XHR calls to [AWS Lambda](/docs/ingest-from/amazon-web-services/integrate-into-aws/aws-lambda-integration/aws-lambda-classic/aws-lambda-extension#lambda-cfg-rum "Monitor Lambda functions written in Python, Node.js, and Java.") or to another instrumented web or application server that uses the [supported technologies](/docs/ingest-from/technology-support#rum-auto-injection "Find technical details related to Dynatrace support for specific platforms and development frameworks."), then it's possible to link user actions and distributed traces. However, these web requests are usually cross-origin requests, so additional configuration is required to achieve the user action to distributed trace correlation. See [Link cross-origin XHR user actions and their distributed traces](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/link-cross-origin-xhrs "Enable the correlation between cross-origin XHR actions and distributed traces.") for details.

### Use of tag managers

We recommend ensuring that the RUM JavaScript is the first executable script on each page, which can be challenging when using a tag manager. If you cannot guarantee this, you may lose informationâsuch as certain timings or user actionsâthat are available only when both the RUM monitoring code and the configuration are fully loaded and initialized.

This risk is exacerbated if you use the [code snippet](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats#code-snippet "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case") in deferred mode, or if you configure the **Script execution** option of the [JavaScript tag](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats#js-tag "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case"), [OneAgent JavaScript tag](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats#oneagent-js-tag "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case"), or [OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats#oneagent-js-tag-sri "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case") to **async** or **defer**.

## Verify agentless monitoring setup

To investigate problems that you might encounter with agentless Real User Monitoring, confirm the following:

* The pages to be monitored contain the RUM JavaScript.
* The RUM JavaScript is correctly downloaded by the browser (assuming you're not using inline injection).

  Use the browser developer tools to check if the response for the RUM JavaScript is `200` and if the response body contains the RUM JavaScript.

* The response of the beacon endpoint starts with `OK(BF)`.
* The application in the Dynatrace web UI shows data.
