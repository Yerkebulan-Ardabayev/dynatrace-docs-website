To access the **World map** view

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the required application.
3. Select the **View geolocation breakdown** tile of the infographic.
4. In the **Geolocation breakdown** section that appears on the left hand-side under the infographic, select **View full world map**.

You can directly pin the world map view to a classic dashboard of your preference by selecting **Pin to dashboard** and selecting the specific dashboard. For details, see [Pin tiles to your dashboard](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/dashboards-classic/charts-and-tiles/pin-tiles-to-your-dashboard "Learn to pin tiles to your dashboards.").

If you don't see data on the world map, you might need to [map your internal IP addresses to locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/map-internal-ip-addresses-to-locations-web "Configure Dynatrace to use local addresses to understand where the users of your web applications are.").
