* Published Feb 06, 2023

Custom applications relate to all digital touchpoints in your environment, from traditional rich client applications to smart IoT applications or even Alexa Skills. Such applications are supported through [Dynatrace OpenKit](/docs/ingest-from/extend-dynatrace/openkit "Learn how you can instrument your application using OpenKit, how you can use Dynatrace OpenKit API methods, and more.").

### Initial setup

[RUM initial setup for custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/custom-rum-initial-setup "Enable and set up Real User Monitoring for custom applications.")

### Customization

* [Dynatrace OpenKit libraries on GitHub](/docs/ingest-from/extend-dynatrace/openkit/dynatrace-openkit-libraries-on-github "Check out the Dynatrace OpenKit libraries on GitHub.")
* [Dynatrace OpenKit API methods](/docs/ingest-from/extend-dynatrace/openkit/dynatrace-openkit-api-methods "Read how Dynatrace OpenKit can be used from the developer's point of view.")
* [Dynatrace OpenKit logging](/docs/ingest-from/extend-dynatrace/openkit/dynatrace-openkit-logging "Learn how logging works with OpenKit.")

### Analyze and use RUM data

* [Analyze user sessions of custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/analyze-and-use/user-session-analysis-custom "Filter user sessions, view sessions of an individual user, and examine crashes, request errors, and report errors for your custom applications.")
* [Check user experience metrics for custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/analyze-and-use/check-usage-metrics-custom "Learn how to use Dynatrace to check the user experience metrics of your custom application.")
* [Analyze web requests for custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/analyze-and-use/analyze-web-requests-custom "Leverage Dynatrace to monitor web requests for your custom applications.")
* [View crash reports for custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/analyze-and-use/crash-reports-custom "Check the latest crash reports for your custom applications.")
* [Leverage user action and user session properties for custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/analyze-and-use/action-and-session-properties-custom "User action and session properties, which are metadata key-value pairs, provide added visibility and deeper analysis of your end users' experience. Using these properties for your applications, you can filter user sessions, add calculated metrics, create charts, and more.")

### Troubleshooting

[Troubleshooting RUM for custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/troubleshooting "Fix issues related to RUM for your custom applications.")

### Additional configuration

* [Configure cost and traffic control for custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/additional-configuration/configure-cost-and-traffic-control-custom "Leverage the cost and traffic control setting in Dynatrace to reduce session usage for custom applications.")
* [Ignore web request errors for custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/additional-configuration/web-request-errors-custom "Stop treating certain HTTP response codes as errors for your custom applications.")
* [Create custom user action names for custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/additional-configuration/naming-rules-custom "Customize automatically generated user action names for your custom applications.")
* [Configure key user actions for custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/additional-configuration/configure-key-user-actions-custom "Mark a user action as a key user action and configure Apdex rating for key user actions of your custom applications.")
* [Adjust Apdex settings for custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/additional-configuration/configure-apdex-custom "Configure the user-satisfaction performance thresholds for your custom application and its key user actions.")
* [Change user experience score thresholds for custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/additional-configuration/configure-user-experience-score-custom "Adjust the user experience score thresholds to meet the specific requirements of your custom application.")
* [Create calculated metrics for custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/additional-configuration/rum-calculated-metrics-custom "Create calculated metrics as well as custom charts based on calculated metrics for your custom applications.")
* [Create USQL custom metrics for custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/additional-configuration/custom-metrics-from-user-sessions-custom-apps "Every time a user session is closed, Dynatrace can extract metrics and store them as time series. Learn how to set up and use USQL custom metrics for custom applications.")
* [Define user action and user session properties for custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/additional-configuration/define-custom-action-and-session-properties "Send metadata to Dynatrace and define action and session properties for your monitored custom applications.")
* [Customize IP address detection for custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/additional-configuration/customize-ip-address-detectio-custom "Change the way Dynatrace determines client IP addresses for your custom applications.")
* [Map internal IP addresses to locations for custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/additional-configuration/map-internal-ip-addresses-to-locations-custom "Configure Dynatrace to use local addresses to understand where the users of your custom applications are.")
* [Configure first-party, third-party, and CDN resource detection for custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/additional-configuration/configure-third-party-and-cdn-content-detection-custom "Manually define third-party and CDN providers along with auto-detected providers for your custom applications.")
* [Use OneAgent as a beacon endpoint for custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/additional-configuration/oneagent-as-beacon-forwarder-custom "Use Dynatrace OneAgent as a beacon endpoint for custom applications.")
* [Delete a custom application](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/additional-configuration/delete-application-custom "Delete your custom applications via the Dynatrace web UI or API.")
