In this article, you will learn about the most important concepts and terminology for distributed tracing in Dynatrace.

### Distributed trace

A distributed trace is a sequence of spans, identified by a unique trace ID, that follows the path of a single request as it traverses through various services and components in a distributed system. In a modern microservice environment, it typically spans multiple services, providing a detailed view of the request's journey and performance. The trace contains semantically different attributes that make it possible to interpret and understand the collected data, helping identify bottlenecks, errors, and latency issues for efficient troubleshooting and optimization.

#### Use cases

* Understand how requests propagate across distributed systems and microservices.
* Use high-quality data generated by distributed systems and microservices for request analysis.
* Quickly understand how each microservice is performing.
* Follow [Dynatrace Intelligence root cause analysis drill-downs](/docs/dynatrace-intelligence/root-cause-analysis/concepts "Get acquainted with root cause analysis concepts.") to identify cause-effect relationships between events.

### Span

A span represents a single operation within a distributed trace, capturing the details of the request's journey through multiple services. Each span includes attributes such as the name, the start timestamp, a list of span events (such as exceptions), the parent's span identifier, and the span kind. This informationâ**span context**â helps to put all spans and events in context with each other, so that you can trace and understand the performance and behavior of individual operations within the distributed system.

Within a trace, when the activityâ*parent span*âis completed, the next activity passes to its *child span*. A span without a parent span is called a trace *root span* and indicates the start of a trace.

The image below shows a trace traversing three services and producing a request for each service. Each request has a root span, one of which is also the root of the trace.

* A is both the first span of the trace and the first span of the request within the first service; additionally, A is a span without a parent. A is both the root of the trace and of the request.
* C is the first span of the request within the second service; additionally, C has a parent (B). C is the root of the second request.
* E is not the first span of the request within the third service. E's parent (D) is the root of the third request.

Learn more about [span semantic fields](/docs/semantic-dictionary/fields#span "Get to know the list of global fields that have a well defined semantic meaning in Dynatrace and can be used across different monitoring types.").

The span context allows a child span to relate to the trace and its parent span. Therefore, the context needs to be propagated within a service (across different threads) but also across services and process boundaries. This typically happens via HTTP headers (like the [W3C trace contextï»¿](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/)) or via unique IDs in messaging systems. To learn more about context propagation, see [Span and trace context propagation in Distributed Traces Classic](/docs/observe/application-observability/distributed-traces/context-propagation "Understand span and trace context propagation in Dynatrace and how to set them up.").

### Attribute

Attributes are key-value pairs that provide details about a span, request, or resource such as response codes, HTTP methods, and URLs. Via attributes, you can group, query, find, and analyze your traces and spans.

#### Use cases

Dynatrace uses attribute metadata to

* [Detect and name services](/docs/observe/application-observability/services/service-detection/service-detection-v1 "Find out how Dynatrace Service Detection v1 detects and names different types of services.").
* Gather data on the trace context and relationships with other entities for [Smartscape topology](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/smartscape-classic "Learn how Smartscape Classic visualizes all the entities and dependencies in your environment.").
* Connect log data to traces for [Logs](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/logs/lma-log-enrichment "Connect your incoming log data to traces for more precise Dynatrace analysis.") or [Logs Classic](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/log-monitoring/log-monitoring-configuration/log-enrichment "Learn how you can connect your incoming log data to traces for more precise Dynatrace analysis.").
* Understand how the duration of a span is affected by [service timings](/docs/observe/application-observability/services-classic/service-analysis-timing "Find out what each time in service analysis means.") (for example, CPU time, network time, or just waiting for other threads) and analyze which code was executed in the context of the span.

#### Best practices

If you collect trace data via

* OpenTelemetry, define [captured attribute settings](/docs/ingest-from/extend-dynatrace/extend-tracing/span-settings "Learn how to configure span settings for OpenTelemetry and OpenTracing.").
* OneAgent, define [requests attribute settings](/docs/observe/application-observability/services/request-attributes "Understand what request attributes are and learn how to use them across all levels of all service-analysis views.").

Learn more about [request attributes](/docs/semantic-dictionary/fields#request-attributes "Get to know the list of global fields that have a well defined semantic meaning in Dynatrace and can be used across different monitoring types.") and [captured attributes](/docs/semantic-dictionary/fields#captured-attributes "Get to know the list of global fields that have a well defined semantic meaning in Dynatrace and can be used across different monitoring types.") semantic fields.

### Service

Services are traversed by distributed traces. On horizontally scaled services, specific **Service Instances** process each span. Services are determined and named based on available attributes or properties that are collected along with the spans.

#### Use cases

* [Segment requests to improve response time degradation](/docs/observe/application-observability/distributed-traces/use-cases/segment-request "Enhance your distributed system performance by segmenting requests with slow response time via Service flow and analyzing their distributed traces.").

### Data collection and context propagation

You can integrate OpenTelemetry and OneAgent to collect trace dataâlike request status, response time, versions, infrastructure information, and other relevant metadata as attributes. The trace context, including the unique trace ID, is then propagated across your apps and microservices.

#### Best practices

Before getting started with distributed tracing, understand how setup and trace data collection differs between OpenTelemetry and OneAgent. The following is an overview of the key differences.

To get started see

* [Automatic setup with OneAgent](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-oneagent "Understand the important concepts related to OneAgent and find out how to install and operate OneAgent on different platforms.")
* [Instrumentation with OpenTelemetry](/docs/ingest-from/opentelemetry/getting-started "How to get your OpenTelemetry data into Dynatrace.")
* [Extend distributed tracing](/docs/ingest-from/extend-dynatrace/extend-tracing "Learn how to extend trace observability in Dynatrace.")

Use OpenTelemetry in combination with OneAgent to enhance your observability coverage, using the best of both.

### PurePathÂ® technology

Dynatrace patented PurePathÂ® technology for distributed tracing, since 2006. PurePathÂ® technology combines distributed tracing information with additional insights like user experience information, logs, metrics, topology information, metadata, and even code-level profiling information to provide the highest level of data fidelity and granularity.

#### Use cases

Analyze data down to code-level detail without ever losing the full context around your environment during drill down, with the highest level of data granularity and fidelity of monitored transactions.
