Apart from automated problem detection, Dynatrace offers you a set of analysis tools that you can use to manually detect problems.

* **CPU profiling** highlights the biggest CPU consumers in your environment and allows you to drill down to the method level of a CPU problem.
* **Memory dump analysis** and **Process crashes** enable you to detect application crashes on Windows and Linux and analyze the core dumps of these crashes.

To access profiling and optimization options

1. Go to ![Profiling & Optimization](https://dt-cdn.net/hub/logos/profiling-optimization.png "Profiling & Optimization") **Profiling & Optimization**.
2. Select the analysis option you want to investigate among **CPU profiling**, **Memory dumps**, and **Process crashes**.

[### Memory dumps

Trigger and analyze Java, .NET, and Node.js memory dumps.](/docs/observe/application-observability/profiling-and-optimization/memory-dump-analysis "Learn how Dynatrace enables you to trigger, download and analyze memory dumps for Java and Node.js.")[### CPU profiling

Understand and analyze the CPU usage of your processes down to the code level.](/docs/observe/application-observability/profiling-and-optimization/cpu-profiling "Learn how you can use Dynatrace to perform enhanced code analysis.")[### Process crashes

Track all application crashes and enable analysis.](/docs/observe/application-observability/profiling-and-optimization/crash-analysis "Learn how Dynatrace can help you gain insight into process crashes.")
