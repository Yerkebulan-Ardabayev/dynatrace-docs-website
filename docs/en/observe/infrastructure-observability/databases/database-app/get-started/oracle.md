Use Dynatrace Extension framework to extend your application observability into data acquired directly from your Oracle database layer and monitor how database server tasks impact your app.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that your system meets the [requirements](/docs/observe/infrastructure-observability/databases/extensions/oracle-database#requirements "Observe, analyze, and optimize the usage, health, and performance of your database.") for full feature support.

## Set up Oracle extension for monitoring

To set up and activate the extension, follow these [detailed activation steps](/docs/observe/infrastructure-observability/databases/extensions/oracle-database#activation-and-setup "Observe, analyze, and optimize the usage, health, and performance of your database.").

## FAQ and troubleshooting

Refer to the Oracle database extension [FAQ](/docs/observe/infrastructure-observability/databases/extensions/oracle-database#faq "Observe, analyze, and optimize the usage, health, and performance of your database.") and [troubleshooting](/docs/observe/infrastructure-observability/databases/extensions/oracle-database#troubleshooting "Observe, analyze, and optimize the usage, health, and performance of your database.") sections.

## Feature sets

[Feature sets](/docs/observe/infrastructure-observability/databases/extensions/oracle-database#feature-sets "Observe, analyze, and optimize the usage, health, and performance of your database.") restrict which metrics are collected when you activate the extension.

## Use cases

Oracle Database monitoring helps you understand your application's database interactions, performance bottlenecks, and resource impact by monitoring executed statements, query patterns, and server health. To learn more, see [Oracle database monitoring use cases](/docs/observe/infrastructure-observability/databases/extensions/oracle-database#use-cases "Observe, analyze, and optimize the usage, health, and performance of your database.").
