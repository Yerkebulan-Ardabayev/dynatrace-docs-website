Dynatrace automatically discovers, baselines, and intelligently monitors Microsoft Azure cloud environments.

## Monitoring and problem detection

Dynatrace Azure monitoring performs AI-based automatic business impact, problem detection, and root cause analysis for all Azure services based on all metrics published to Azure Monitor. This analysis can be additionally extended by full-stack monitoring provided by OneAgent deployed on compute resources such as Azure Virtual Machines, Azure App Service, and Azure Kubernetes Service. All of the entities can also be subject to comprehensive log analysis.

In addition to the above, Dynatrace enables the understanding of workload applied Azure resources and environment dynamics per region.

Azure monitoring is available for all Dynatrace customers, regardless of whether their Dynatrace cluster is SaaS-based or Managed.

## Ease of use and convenient visualization

Azure monitoring comes with consistent out-of-the-box metrics, dashboards, and alerts immediately after monitoring is enabled.

The measurements and analysis of core Azure services are visualized on a purpose-built infographics dashboard (see the gallery). Convenient reports and dashboards are also available for business impact analysis and topology maps.

## Flexibility

Dynatrace users can select which services and instances are monitored and how this process is performed. This selection can be done as part of the initial monitoring setup or at any later point. This also applies to new services enabled on the Azure cloud or added by Microsoft.

It is possible to choose monitoring metrics for each of the supporting services. Equally, all the dashboards for Azure monitoring can be cloned and easily customized as needed.

## Hybrid environments

Tracking of services and dependencies is not limited to Azure. Thanks to Dynatrace Intelligence and its ability to process data from all types of environments, Dynatrace is optimized for monitoring hybrid environments, including business applications spanning across multiple cloud and virtualization platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, VMware, Kubernetes, Openshift, and on-premises infrastructure.
