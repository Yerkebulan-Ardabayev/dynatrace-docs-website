## How does rollout work?

Dynatrace follows an agile development process with sprints every two weeks.

### Dynatrace SaaS

Every sprint is publicly released. To guarantee maximum reliability, we follow a staged rollout process that typically takes under two weeks to complete.

* SaaS **rollout** is the two-week period during which we roll out a new release to Dynatrace clusters.
* **Rollout start** is the date when the two-week period begins.
* Your cluster update will occur at some time within the two-week rollout period.

### Dynatrace OneAgent and ActiveGate

Every second sprint is publicly released. To guarantee maximum reliability, we follow a staged rollout process that typically takes under four weeks to complete.
