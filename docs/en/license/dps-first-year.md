The first year of a Dynatrace Platform Subscription is designed to be seamless, transparent, and value-driven.
From onboarding to extending your subscription, each phase is supported by tools, guidance, and automation to ensure customers realize the platform's full potential.

At its core, it will include three phases:

## 1. Onboarding

Onboarding consists of:

### Sign a DPS agreement

It's fast and simple.

Work with your sales partner and easily scope your usage, define your annual commitment, and gain access to the full Dynatrace platform.
There is no need to pre-allocate a budget.

### Account setup

Gain access to Dynatrace capabilities.

You'll always be in control and have the full support of our fantastic Dynatrace support team.
Optional onboarding sessions and check-ins with our team will happen to ensure a successful onboarding.

## 2. Value discovery and optimization

During your first year, you'll be able to explore Dynatrace and learn how to most effectively use your data.

### Capability exploration

Teams begin using key capabilities (for example, Full-Stack Monitoring, Logs, and AppEngine).
The full power of our platform is yours, just like that.

### Track usage in real time

Monitor consumption and costs via Account Management or the DPS API.
This will support decision-making and further growth.

### Forecast & alerts

Built-in forecasting tools like cost monitors or budgets help you stay ahead of budget trends and usage spikes.

## 3. Term-end preparation

### Seamless transition into next year

Your annual commitment resets at the end of the year, and a new period starts.
You can always check historical periods in Account Management.

### Easy on-demand handling

You can grow beyond your annual commitment without friction.
Usage is billed monthly at the same rates without any penalty-style overages.
