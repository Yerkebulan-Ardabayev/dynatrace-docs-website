Log - Query feature overview

This page describes how the Log Management & Analytics - Query DPS capability is consumed and billed.
For an overview of the capability, including its main features, see [Log Analytics (DPS)](/docs/license/capabilities/log-analytics "Learn how Dynatrace Log Analytics consumption is calculated using the Dynatrace Platform Subscription model.").

The usage of ![Distributed Tracing](https://dt-cdn.net/images/distributed-tracing-4ed13d1274.svg "Distributed Tracing") **Distributed Tracing** and ![Services](https://dt-cdn.net/hub/logos/services.png "Services") **Services** is included with Dynatrace.
No consumption is generated by these apps.

## How consumption is calculated: GiB scanned

Queried data is the volume of data read during the execution of a DQL query.
It is calculated per gibibyte scanned (GiB scanned).

Apply the following calculation to determine your consumption for the Query data-usage dimension:

`consumption = (number of GiB of uncompressed data read during query execution) Ã (GiB scanned price as per your rate card)`

Query consumption is based on the GiB of data scanned to return a result.
The highest potential cost for a query is equal to the volume of logs within the queryâs search range times the price on your rate card.

Grail applies various optimizations to improve response time and reduce cost.
In some cases, these optimizations will identify portions of data that are not relevant to the query resultâthe price for scanning that data is discounted by 98%.

The impact of Grail scan optimizations varies based on data and query attributes.
It may evolve as Dynatrace continues to improve Grail query intelligence.

## Track your consumption

This section describes the different Dynatrace tools that you can use to track consumption and costs.

### Track your consumption with Metrics

Dynatrace provides a built-in usage metric that helps you understand and analyze your organization's consumption of Log Management & Analytics - Query.
To use this metric, in Data Explorer, enter `DPS` in the **Search** field.

Log Management & Analytics - Query
:   Key: `builtin:billing.log.query.usage`

    Dimension: Byte

    Resolution: 1 hour

    Description: Number of bytes read during the execution of a DQL query, including sampled data.

Example metric usage: monitor the total number of bytes scanned in hourly intervals

You can monitor the total scanned bytes for [Query](#query) in hourly intervals for any selected timeframe using the metric `builtin:billing.log.query.usage`.

The example below shows usage aggregated in 1-hour intervals between 2023-09-04 and 2023-09-11 (last 7 days).

### Track your consumption with DQL queries

Example metric usage: monitor the total number of gibibytes scanned

The following DQL query provides an overview of total [Query](#query) usage in gibibytes scanned:

```
fetch dt.system.events



| filter event.kind == "BILLING_USAGE_EVENT"



| filter event.type == "Log Management & Analytics - Query"



| dedup event.id



| summarize {



data_read_bytes = sum(billed_bytes)



}, by: {



startHour = bin(timestamp, 1d)



}
```

The example below shows the daily query usage visualized in a line chart for the last 30 days:

### Track your consumption and costs in Account Management

You can also view usage metrics in Account Management.
Go to [**Account Management**ï»¿](https://myaccount.dynatrace.com/) > **Subscription** > **Overview** > **Cost and usage details** > **Usage summary** and select the **Log Management & Analytics - Query** capability.

### Track your consumption and costs via API

You can query metrics via the [Environment API - Metrics API v2](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/metric-v2 "Retrieve metric information via Metrics v2 API.").
