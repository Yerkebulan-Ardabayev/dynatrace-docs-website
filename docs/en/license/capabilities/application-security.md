[Application Security](/docs/secure/application-security "Access the Dynatrace Application Security functionalities.") helps secure cloud-native and on-premise applications at runtime with intelligent automation.
This includes visualizing, analyzing, and monitoring security vulnerabilities in your environment and blocking detected attacks on your applications.

This page describes the different application security capabilities and the features that they provide with a DPS subscription.

For information about how usage of a specific capability translates to consumption of your DPS license commit, see

* [Runtime Vulnerability Analytics](/docs/license/capabilities/application-security/runtime-vulnerability-analytics "Learn how your consumption of the Dynatrace Runtime Vulnerability Analytics (RVA) DPS capability is billed and charged.")
* [Runtime Application Protection](/docs/license/capabilities/application-security/runtime-application-protection "Learn how how your consumption of the Runtime Application Protection (RAP) DPS capability is billed and charged.")
* [Security Posture Management](/docs/license/capabilities/application-security/security-posture-management "Learn how your consumption of the Dynatrace Security Posture Management (SPM) DPS capability is billed and charged.")

## Runtime Vulnerability Analytics

[Dynatrace Runtime Vulnerability Analytics](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics "Monitor, visualize, analyze, and remediate third-party and code-level vulnerabilities, track the remediation progress, and create monitoring rules.") enables you to detect, visualize, analyze, and monitor the remediation of third-party and code-level vulnerabilities in your environment.

These vulnerabilities include

* [Third-party vulnerabilities](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/third-party-vulnerabilities "Monitor, visualize, analyze, and remediate third-party vulnerabilities, track the remediation progress, and create monitoring rules."), which can arise when your application uses a specific library or language runtime containing vulnerabilities.
* [Code-level vulnerabilities](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/code-level-vulnerabilities "Monitor, visualize, and analyze code-level vulnerabilities."), which can arise when Dynatrace Application Security detects a vulnerability in your code by evaluating the requests passing through your applications.

## Runtime Application Protection (RAP)

[Dynatrace Runtime Application Protection](/docs/secure/application-security/application-protection "Set up and configure Dynatrace Runtime Application Protection to monitor attacks and attack-generated code-level vulnerabilities.") leverages code-level insights and transaction analysis to detect and block attacks on your applications automatically and in real time.

## Security Posture Management (SPM)

[Security Posture Management (SPM)](/docs/secure/application-security/security-posture-management-hub "Assess, manage, and take action on misconfigurations and violations against security hardening guidelines and regulatory compliance standards.") provides ongoing monitoring and automated assessment for KubernetesÂ® environments.
With insights into configuration, compliance issues, and risk management, customers can maintain a strong security posture.

This includes [Kubernetes Security Posture Management (KSPM)](/docs/ingest-from/setup-on-k8s/deployment/security-posture-management "Configure and enable Security Posture Management in Kubernetes."), which focuses on identifying and mitigating security risks in your Kubernetes clusters.
