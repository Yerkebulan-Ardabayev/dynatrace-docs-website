A Proof of Concept (POC) is a limited trial that lets existing Dynatrace customers use specific features, such as a new capability, with their real-life data.
During the POC period, usage of the feature is free within an agreed-upon budget.

If you're interested in starting a POC for a specific DPS feature, contact your local sales representative, account executive, or solution engineer.

## Prerequisites

* You already have an active DPS subscription.
* You want to run a POC on your production environment.
  POCs are not available for trial environments.
* The capability that you want to trial is already available on your rate card.
  Your rate card is visible at **Subscription** > **Pricing**.
* To view POC costs and usage, you need access to the [**Subscription history**](/docs/license/subscription-history "View the subscription history of your Dynatrace environment, including usage and cumulative costs for each subscription.") page in Account Management.

## About

A Proof of Concept is run on top of an existing DPS subscription.
It includes the specific subset of features that you're trialing.
All usage and costs is booked against the POC, and is free of charge during the free credit period.

During a POC, you can use the specific features as if they are part of your normal DPS subscription.

## View usage details

All consumption and costs related to POCs are available on the [**Subscription history**](/docs/license/subscription-history "View the subscription history of your Dynatrace environment, including usage and cumulative costs for each subscription.") page.
