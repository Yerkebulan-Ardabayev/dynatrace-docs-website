Dynatrace Platform Subscription (DPS) is your licensing model for all Dynatrace capabilities.
It allows you the flexibility to use any Dynatrace capability at any volume, at any time.
With DPS, your organization can quickly adapt to ever-changing technical and business requirements while avoiding cumbersome licensing bureaucracy.
Hourly reporting on usage and daily updates on your current budget provide you with all the transparency you expect.

For more information, see [Billing report](/docs/license/billing-reports "View your billing to see details about accrued costs per booking date. Use this view to determine which Dynatrace monitoring costs were recognized and booked on which day.").

## Billing period

A Dynatrace Platform Subscription agreement has a minimum commitment of 1 year.
Typically, a DPS agreement is signed for 1â3 years.

Your organization's consumption of each Dynatrace capability accrues costs towards your annual commitment as specified on the rate card.
Each platform capability has a price point defined in the rate card as included with your agreement.

Once you reach your annual commitment, you can continue to use Dynatrace while incurring on-demand usage.
Dynatrace applies the same rate card for on-demand usage without additional fees or premium pricing.
You receive monthly invoices for on-demand costs until the next annual commitment period begins.

## FAQ

### In what timezone are daily usage and cost analysis calculated?

Dynatrace meters usage based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
All references to time and date are therefore to be understood as UTC+00:00.

Daily usage and costs are based on UTC and run from `00:00:00` on the start date of your agreement to `23:59:59` on the end date.

### Is the annual commitment period always 12 months? What if I have a three-year subscription?

Multi-year subscriptions are broken down into annual (12-month) subscription periods.

Dynatrace may adjust the subscription period for your agreement to accommodate your needs.
For example, the first period of a multi-year agreement might actually be just a six-month subscription period, which is then followed by two 12-month subscription periods.

### What currency is used for Dynatrace Platform Subscription?

Your subscription agreement determines the currency that is used for billing.
The currency code is shown on all Account Management cost views as a three-digit abbreviation (for example, USD, GBP, or EUR).
The applied currency code might not be displayed until after the first cost metrics are calculated.

### How can I view my usage from a previous license?

The [View your previous DPS periods via subscription history](/docs/license/subscription-history "View the subscription history of your Dynatrace environment, including usage and cumulative costs for each subscription.") page shows active and expired licenses and subscriptions, including POCs.

### How can I see the consumption that is booked to a POC?

The [View your previous DPS periods via subscription history](/docs/license/subscription-history "View the subscription history of your Dynatrace environment, including usage and cumulative costs for each subscription.") page shows active and expired POCs.
For a specific POC, select **View details** to get a breakdown of costs and usage at the environment or capability level.
