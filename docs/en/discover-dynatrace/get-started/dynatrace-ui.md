If you haven't upgraded to the latest Dynatrace, [go to the bottom of this page](#menu) for help with the old interface.

## Dock

The Dock is your starting point. It's the expandable/collapsable panel on the left of the Dynatrace display. This is your tool belt, which you can equip with links to applications that you need daily.

Use the Dock to:

* Quickly switch between your pinned or recently used apps.
* Go to the Launcher, global platform search, all apps in your environment, additional support resources, and your user preferences.

* [**Search**](#search) enables you to search the platform.
* [**Apps**](#apps)
* [Pinned and active apps](#pinned), depending on your configuration and activity.
