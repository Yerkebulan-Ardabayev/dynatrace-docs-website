Understand essential concepts and key terms used in ![Threats & Exploits](https://dt-cdn.net/images/attacks-512-b922840b12.png "Threats & Exploits") **Threats & Exploits**.

Action
:   The action taken by the monitoring authority as a response of a detection. In the case of Dynatrace-monitored environments, the action taken by [Runtime Application Protection](/docs/secure/application-security/application-protection "Set up and configure Dynatrace Runtime Application Protection to monitor attacks and attack-generated code-level vulnerabilities.") (RAP action).

Actor IP
:   The client IP address from which the request originated.

    * Example: `10.9.3.4`

Affected object
:   The object that is affected by an exploit (for Dynatrace-monitored findings, the process).

    * Example: `BloatedDotNetSoftwareGroup-IG-1`

Code location
:   Shows where the actual vulnerability is in the code (the location where the vulnerable function is called from).

    * Example: `SQL injection at DatabaseManager.updateBio():82`

Detection finding events
:   A detection finding event is generated when suspicious activity is observed around an object. For details, see [Detection finding events](/docs/secure/threat-observability/concepts#detection "Basic concepts related to Threat Observability").

Entry point
:   A point in the code where an attacker could enter the application, for example, by passing user input fields to the application (such as a login form or search bar).

Entry point function
:   The function where the malicious payload was accessed in the attacked process.

    * Example: `System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand.ExecuteReader()`

Exploits
:   Any request (call) from a certain client IP to your application code with malicious intent (for example, to access or delete protected information with SQL injection) targeting a code-level vulnerability.

HTTP headers and parameters
:   The HTTP headers and parameters of the request. Only the HTTP parameters used in the vulnerable functions are listed. Some headers identify the originating (client) IP address when a client connects to a web server through an HTTP proxy, a CDN, or a load balancer. The headers for identifying the client IP address aren't configurable.

Target
:   The attacked host, service, or database.

    * Example: `HOST-IG-1-5001`

Threat intelligence enrichment
:   Threat intelligence enrichment adds external reputation data to observables such as IP addresses using trusted threat intelligence sources such as [AbuseIPDBï»¿](https://www.abuseipdb.com/) or [VirusTotalï»¿](https://www.virustotal.com). This provides additional context for faster triage and helps enhance detection finding results.

    For details, see [Enrich IP addresses](/docs/secure/threats-and-exploits/manage-results#enrich "Filter, format, and sort detection findings.").

URL path
:   The path used in the HTTP request to reach and potentially exploit the vulnerability.

    * Example: `/user/1218/bio`

User-controlled input
:   The input used to exploit the vulnerability. If there's a key for the input (for example, an HTTP parameter name or an HTTP header name), it's displayed after the colon.

    * Example: `HTTP parameter value: bioText`

Vulnerable function
:   The function that used a part of the attacker's payload, which resulted in the exploitation of the vulnerability.

    * Example: `System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand.ExecuteReader()`
