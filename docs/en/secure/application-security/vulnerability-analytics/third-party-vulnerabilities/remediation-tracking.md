# Remediation tracking

# Remediation tracking

* Explanation
* Updated on Jan 14, 2025

This page refers to the classic ![Third Party Vulnerabilities](https://dt-cdn.net/images/third-party-vulnerabilities-512-1b375181bf.png "Third Party Vulnerabilities") **Third-Party Vulnerabilities** app, which is deprecated. If you're currently using this app, we recommend transitioning to the corresponding [![Vulnerabilities](https://dt-cdn.net/images/vulnerabilities-highresolution-1025-9279da9743.png "Vulnerabilities") **Vulnerabilities**](/docs/secure/vulnerabilities "Prioritize and efficiently manage vulnerabilities in your monitored environments.") in the latest Dynatrace experience, which offers enhanced functionality and ongoing support. For details, see [Vulnerabilities upgrade guide](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/vulnerabilities-upgrade-classic-to-latest "Upgrade from the classic Thirdâparty and Codeâlevel vulnerabilities apps to the Vulnerabilities app in the latest Dynatrace.").

Remediation tracking allows you to track the remediation progress of individual entities ([process groups](#pg), [processes](#process), or [Kubernetes nodes](#k8s)) that are affected by a third-party vulnerability.

For process groups and Kubernetes nodes, you can control which of these entities you want to track and which you want to discard. For instance, if you think an entity isn't relevant or is a false positive, you can mute it. By muting an entity, you hide third-party vulnerabilities for certain process groups or Kubernetes nodes.

* Muted entities aren't taken into consideration in any context, such as Davis Security Score or Application Security metrics.
* To ensure proper handling of newly affected entities, muting all entities doesn't mute the vulnerability itself. Other affected entities may exist that aren't visible to a particular user due to permission restrictions or the selected management zone.

## Remediation tracking for process groups

![Process group overview related to a vulnerability](https://dt-cdn.net/images/2024-02-14-15-17-20-1599-a5f27c81bb.png)

### Access remediation tracking for process groups

To access remediation tracking for process groups that are related to a vulnerability

1. Go to ![Third Party Vulnerabilities](https://dt-cdn.net/images/third-party-vulnerabilities-512-1b375181bf.png "Third Party Vulnerabilities") **Third-Party Vulnerabilities**.
2. Select **Details** for the vulnerability you want.
3. Select **View all process groups**.

On the **Process group overview** page, you can

* [Filter for process groups](#filter-pg)
* [Track remediation progress for process groups](#track-pg)
* [Change vulnerability status of process groups](#status-pg)

### Filter for process groups

You can filter for process groups by

* **Entity name**: Full or partial name.
* **Status**: `Affected`, `Resolved`, or `Muted`.
* **Tracking link**: Full or partial title of a tracking link that has already been set up. For details, see [tracking link](#tracking-link-pg).
* **Public internet exposure**: `Public network` or `Not detected`.
* **Reachable data assets**: `Within range` or `None within range`.
* **Name of vulnerable function in use**: You can use two colons in your search term (`<class>::<function>`) to specify the function and/or class name you're looking for:

  + `<class>::` to filter by a specific class name.
  + `<class>::<function>` to filter for a specific function in a specific class.
  + `<function>` to filter for a specific function name in any class.

  Example how to filter by name of vulnerable function in use

  You can find the class and function names in the **Vulnerable functions** section on the details page of a vulnerability.

  ![Class and function attributes of a vulnerable function](https://dt-cdn.net/images/2024-01-04-16-16-20-800-c09240a325.png)

  This section is not displayed

  + If no vulnerable function information is provided by Snyk or the Dynatrace security research team.
  + For runtime vulnerabilities, which are based on the NVD feed.

  In the example above, the class is `org.apache.http.client.utils.URIUtils`, and the function is `extractHost`. On the remediation tracking page of process groups related to a vulnerability, you can use the following syntax to filter

  + By class: `org.apache.http.client.utils.URIUtils::`
  + By function: `extractHost`
  + By the function in the class: `org.apache.http.client.utils.URIUtils::extractHost`

  Example result of filtering by class:

  ![Example filtering by class on the remediation tracking for process groups](https://dt-cdn.net/images/2024-02-14-15-26-12-1649-c4932e535d.png)
* **Vulnerable functions usage**: `In use`, `Not in use`, or `Restart required`.

  For more information about `Restart required`, see [FAQ: How can I know if information about vulnerable functions is outdated and what can I do about it?](/docs/secure/faq#outdated-vulnerable-functions "Frequently asked questions about Dynatrace Application Security.").
* **Assessment accuracy**:

  + `Full` filters for related process groups that run in Full-Stack Monitoring mode.
  + `Reduced` filters for related process groups that run in Infrastructure Monitoring mode or OneAgent Discovery mode.

  For details, see [Monitoring modes](/docs/secure/application-security#monitoring-modes "Access the Dynatrace Application Security functionalities.").

### Track remediation progress for process groups

The process group list provides the following information.

#### Process group

* The name of the related process group with a link to the process group details page.
* The number of currently affected processes out of the total number of processes in that process group, indicating the remediation progress.

#### Risk assessment

* If the vulnerability affects a process group that, based on the [Dynatrace entity model (Smartscape)](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/smartscape-classic "Learn how Smartscape Classic visualizes all the entities and dependencies in your environment."), is exposed to the internet, the public internet exposure symbol is displayed.
* If the vulnerability affects a process group that, based on the Dynatrace entity model, has database access, the reachable data symbol is displayed.

#### Status

* Current status of the related process group (`Affected`, `Resolved`, or `Muted`).

#### Tracking link

To track a vulnerability's remediation progress, you can add links to tickets created in your own issue tracking system for the affected entity. Once you add a tracking link, select it to navigate to the associated URL, which opens in a new page. You can easily check, for example, if someone is already working on fixing the vulnerability.

![tracking-link](https://dt-cdn.net/images/2023-09-13-17-53-50-337-77c482d850.png)

You can add, update, and delete a tracking link [individually](#link-pg) (for one process group at a time) or [in bulk](#link-pgs) (for several process groups at the same time).
