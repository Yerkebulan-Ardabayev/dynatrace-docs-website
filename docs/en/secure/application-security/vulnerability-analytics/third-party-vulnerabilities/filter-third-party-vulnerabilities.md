# Filter or change status of third-party vulnerabilities

# Filter or change status of third-party vulnerabilities

* Explanation
* Updated on Jun 03, 2023

This page refers to the classic ![Third Party Vulnerabilities](https://dt-cdn.net/images/third-party-vulnerabilities-512-1b375181bf.png "Third Party Vulnerabilities") **Third-Party Vulnerabilities** app, which is deprecated. If you're currently using this app, we recommend transitioning to the corresponding [![Vulnerabilities](https://dt-cdn.net/images/vulnerabilities-highresolution-1025-9279da9743.png "Vulnerabilities") **Vulnerabilities**](/docs/secure/vulnerabilities "Prioritize and efficiently manage vulnerabilities in your monitored environments.") in the latest Dynatrace experience, which offers enhanced functionality and ongoing support. For details, see [Vulnerabilities upgrade guide](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/vulnerabilities-upgrade-classic-to-latest "Upgrade from the classic Thirdâparty and Codeâlevel vulnerabilities apps to the Vulnerabilities app in the latest Dynatrace.").

Once you [enable third-party vulnerability detection](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics#tpv-detection "Monitor, visualize, analyze, and remediate third-party and code-level vulnerabilities, track the remediation progress, and create monitoring rules.") and see the [list of third-party vulnerabilities](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/third-party-vulnerabilities/manage-third-party-vulnerabilities#list "Monitor the security issues of your third-party libraries.") appear in ![Third Party Vulnerabilities](https://dt-cdn.net/images/third-party-vulnerabilities-512-1b375181bf.png "Third Party Vulnerabilities") **Third-Party Vulnerabilities**, there are several ways you can organize them for easy management and to prioritize issues:

## Filter vulnerabilities

You can filter vulnerabilities by

* [Recommended fixes](#dsa)
* [Vulnerability details](#details), [global timeframe](#timeframe), and [management zone](#management-zones) (you can combine any of these filters)

### Filter by recommended fixes with Davis Security Advisor

To filter by recommended fixes, on the **Third-party vulnerabilities** page, select an upgrade and then select **Add as filter**.

* After adding a recommended fix as a filter, you can extend filtering by [vulnerability details](#details).
* You can add multiple filters for recommended fixes all at once. In this case, you get a cumulated list of vulnerabilities based on the selected fixes.
* If you use the management zones filter, you'll get a list of third-party vulnerabilities that affect the selected management zone.

You won't receive recommendations for

* Muted vulnerabilities
* Vulnerabilities filtered by the global filter in a past timeframe
* Resolved vulnerabilities

For more information about Davis Security Advisor, see [Davis Security Advisor calculations](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/third-party-vulnerabilities/davis-security-advisor "Get recommendations for security fixes from Davis Security Advisor.").

### Filter by vulnerability details

In the filter bar, the following filters are available.

You can combine any of the filters, but you cannot use the same filter more than once per search.

* **Risk assessment**:

  + `Public internet exposure`: Displays vulnerabilities that affect at least one process that is exposed to the internet.

    This filter isn't available for vulnerabilities in the Kubernetes technology.
  + `Reachable data assets`: Displays vulnerabilities that affect at least one process that has database access.

    This filter isn't available for vulnerabilities in the Kubernetes technology.
  + `Public exploit published`: Displays vulnerabilities that are exploited by known malicious code.
  + `Vulnerable functions in use`: Displays vulnerabilities that have any vulnerable functions in use by a process (this might indicate a higher exploitation risk).
  + `Reduced accuracy`: Displays vulnerabilities that have related hosts running in Infrastructure Monitoring mode or OneAgent Discovery mode. For details, see [Monitoring modes](/docs/secure/application-security#monitoring-modes "Access the Dynatrace Application Security functionalities.").
* **Risk level**: Displays vulnerabilities based on their severity (`Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`, `None`).

For details about risk levels, see [Davis Security Score calculations](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/third-party-vulnerabilities/davis-security-score "Calculate the Davis Security Score and predict potential vulnerability risks with Davis AI.").

* **Snyk/CVE ID**: Displays a particular vulnerability based on

  + The Snyk ID (for example, `SNYK-JAVA-ORGAPACHEXMLBEANS-1060048`), for Snyk-based vulnerabilities.
  + The CVE ID (for example, `CVE-2017-5645`), for NVD-based vulnerabilities.
* **Status**:

  + `Open`: Displays active vulnerabilities.
  + `Resolved`: Displays vulnerabilities that have been closed automatically because the root cause (for example, loading a vulnerable library) is no longer present. For more information, see [Vulnerability evaluation: Resolution](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/vulnerability-evaluation#tpv-resolution "Explore the mechanism for generating third-party and code-level vulnerabilities in Dynatrace.").
  + `Muted`: Displays the active and resolved vulnerabilities that have been silenced by request.
* **Technology**: Displays vulnerabilities in one of the supported technologies (`Kubernetes`, `Node.js`,`Java`, `.NET`, `PHP`, `Python`, `Go`).
* **Technology runtimes**: Displays only library-based (`only vulnerable libraries`) or runtime-based (`only vulnerable runtimes`) vulnerabilities.
* **Vulnerable component**: Displays vulnerabilities based on part of a vulnerable component name.
* **Vulnerability ID**: Displays a particular vulnerability by selecting its Dynatrace-provided ID (for example, `S-4423`).
* **Affected or related entity**: Displays vulnerabilities that affect or relate to specific entities. Select and enter any combination of the following: `Process group name`, `Host name`, `Kubernetes workload name`, `Kubernetes cluster name`, `Tag`. For `Tag`, you can use tags on a host, process, and process group, with the syntax `key:value` or `key`. For more information about tagging, see [Define and apply tags](/docs/manage/tags-and-metadata/setup/how-to-define-tags "Find out how to define and apply tags manually and automatically.").

  If a vulnerability affects more than 5,000 processes, the **Affected or related entity** filter may not be able to find all vulnerabilities impacted by the entered entity.

### Filter by global timeframe

You can use the global timeframe selector to filter third-party vulnerabilities on the following pages:

* On the **Third-party vulnerabilities** page, it displays vulnerabilities that were open within the selected global timeframe. However, the data displayed about an entry reflects the current status of the entry, not the historical status.
* On the vulnerability details page, it displays entities that were affected and libraries that were vulnerable during the selected global timeframe. An affected entity or a vulnerable component is shown:

  + If it was already affected or vulnerable during the selected timeframe.
  + If it's still affected or vulnerable.

### Filter by management zone

You can use the management zones filter on the **Third-party vulnerabilities** list and details pages.

#### How the filter applies

For each case, the filter applies to different components:

* On the **Third-party vulnerabilities** page

  + Filtering by management zone applies only to the **Vulnerability** field.
  + Data in all the other vulnerability fields is based on the whole environment.
* On the third-party vulnerability details page

  + Filtering by management zone applies only to the **Vulnerable components** and **Related entities** sections.
  + Data in all the other sections is based on the whole environment.

#### How management zones are calculated

Management zone calculation is based on processes (or Kubernetes node, in the case of Kubernetes vulnerabilities). Management zones are calculated when a vulnerability is opened and every 15 minutes after that until the vulnerability is resolved. A management zone is affected by a vulnerability if a process (or Kubernetes node, in the case of Kubernetes vulnerabilities) of the management zone uses a vulnerable component that has the reported vulnerability.

#### How resolved vulnerabilities behave

* When a vulnerability stops affecting a management zone, it won't show up when you filter for that management zone.
* When a vulnerability is resolved (when it has stopped affecting the whole environment), it shows up regardless of the selected management zone.

#### Management zone limitations

A maximum of 1,000 management zones are stored for a vulnerability. If a vulnerability affects more than 1,000 management zones, you are only able to filter for the 1,000 management zones that are stored with the vulnerability.

## Change vulnerability status

### Options to change status

You can:

* **Mute** (silence) vulnerabilities that are

  + Open, if you don't consider them important
  + Resolved, if you don't want to deal with them if they are reopened
* **Unmute** vulnerabilities that are muted, if you consider them important.
* **Change the vulnerability status** by selecting a new reason for the current status or adding more information to the current status.

* Muted vulnerabilities don't appear on the list of vulnerabilities unless you filter for `Status: muted`.
* Unmuting an open vulnerability makes it active againâits status changes back to `Open`, and the vulnerability shows up again in the list of vulnerabilities.
* Unmuting a resolved vulnerability changes its status back to `Resolved`, and the vulnerability shows up again in the list of vulnerabilities when you filter for `Resolved` vulnerabilities.

### Ways to change status

You can change the vulnerability status individually or in bulk:

* **Individually** (one vulnerability at a time). You have two options:

  + On the **Third-party vulnerabilities** page, under the **Details** for the selected vulnerability, select **Change status**, select the new status, enter any additional information, and then select **Save**.
  + On the third-party vulnerability details page, in the upper-right corner of the page, select **Change status**, select the new status, enter any additional information, and then select **Save**.
* **In bulk** (for multiple vulnerabilities at once, for example based on specific [filters](#details)). On the **Third-party vulnerabilities** page, you have two options:

  + Select multiple vulnerabilities that are displayed on one page (select the vulnerabilities you want, then select **Yes, change status**, select the new status, enter any additional information, and then select **Save**).
  + Select all vulnerabilities that are displayed on one page (select the **Vulnerability** column in the vulnerabilities list, then select **Yes, change status**, select the new status, enter any additional information, and then select **Save**).

  The option to perform bulk changes isn't available to users with view-only access. The **Manage security problems** permission is required. For details on permission management, see [Fine-tune permissions](/docs/secure/application-security#restrict-permissions "Access the Dynatrace Application Security functionalities.").

You need to wait up to a minute for the changes to take effect. Refresh the page to see your changes.

### Show status changes

The last five status changes of the vulnerability are logged in the **Vulnerability evolution** section of a vulnerability details page.

* Select **Show more** for the next five status changes.
* Select **Details** to see who changed the status of the vulnerability, the reason for changing the status, and any additional comments.
