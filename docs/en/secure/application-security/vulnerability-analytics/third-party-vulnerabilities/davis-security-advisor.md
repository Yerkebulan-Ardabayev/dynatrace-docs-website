This page refers to the classic ![Third Party Vulnerabilities](https://dt-cdn.net/images/third-party-vulnerabilities-512-1b375181bf.png "Third Party Vulnerabilities") **Third-Party Vulnerabilities** app, which is deprecated. If you're currently using this app, we recommend transitioning to the corresponding [![Vulnerabilities](https://dt-cdn.net/images/vulnerabilities-highresolution-1025-9279da9743.png "Vulnerabilities") **Vulnerabilities**](/docs/secure/vulnerabilities "Prioritize and efficiently manage vulnerabilities in your monitored environments.") in the latest Dynatrace experience, which offers enhanced functionality and ongoing support. For details, see [Vulnerabilities upgrade guide](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/vulnerabilities-upgrade-classic-to-latest "Upgrade from the classic Thirdâparty and Codeâlevel vulnerabilities apps to the Vulnerabilities app in the latest Dynatrace.").

The Davis Security Advisor is displayed in ![Third Party Vulnerabilities](https://dt-cdn.net/images/third-party-vulnerabilities-512-1b375181bf.png "Third Party Vulnerabilities") **Third-Party Vulnerabilities** above the vulnerability list on the **Third-party vulnerabilities** page. It recommends the fixes that would most improve the overall security of your environment.

Each recommendation contains

* The library that needs to be updated (for example, `jackson-mapper-asl`)
* The library technology logo (for example, )
* The number of the most severe vulnerabilities that will be fixed after updating the library (for example, `Solves 1 critical`)
* The total number of vulnerabilities that will be fixed (for example, `4 vulnerabilities total`).

### Basis for calculation

To calculate recommended fixes, Davis Security Advisor takes into consideration all third-party vulnerabilities that are currently open and not muted; resolved or muted vulnerabilities aren't taken into account. Fixes are tailored to your environment and ranked based on how much they improve the overall security of your environment.

### Grouping

DSA groups specific libraries that trigger vulnerabilities to simplify remediation efforts.
When calculating the advice, Davis Security Advisor ignores the specific version of the library. All shown libraries contain known vulnerabilities and should be updated to the latest version.

### Advice ranking

Advice is ranked based on the severity of the third-party vulnerabilities. Advice regarding a critical vulnerability, for example, is ranked higher than advice for a high-severity vulnerability.

The severity of a vulnerability is calculated based on [Davis Security Score](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/third-party-vulnerabilities/davis-security-score "Calculate the Davis Security Score and predict potential vulnerability risks with Davis AI."), so you can focus on fixing vulnerabilities that are relevant in your environment, instead of on those that have only a theoretical impact.

### Filtering

To filter by recommended fixes, see [Filter third-party vulnerabilities by recommended fixes with Davis Security Advisor](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/third-party-vulnerabilities/filter-third-party-vulnerabilities#dsa-filter "Organize third-party vulnerabilities for easy management and to prioritize issues.").
