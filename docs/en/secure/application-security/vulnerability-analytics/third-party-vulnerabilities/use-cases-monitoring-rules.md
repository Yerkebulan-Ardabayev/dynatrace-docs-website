Below are some common scenarios for defining [monitoring rules](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/third-party-vulnerabilities/define-monitoring-rules-tpv "Create, modify, and delete custom monitoring rules for Dynatrace-monitored processes.") for third-party vulnerabilities [based on resource attributes and Kubernetes labels](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/third-party-vulnerabilities/define-monitoring-rules-tpv#new "Create, modify, and delete custom monitoring rules for Dynatrace-monitored processes.").

## Monitor only the processes on specific hosts

1. In Dynatrace, go to **Settings** > **Application Security** > **General settings** > **Third-party Vulnerability Analytics** and set **Global third-party vulnerability detection control** to **Do not monitor**.
2. Find the host on which you want to monitor processes (for example, via [![Infrastructure & Operations](https://dt-cdn.net/images/infrasctucture-operations-highresolution-1025-07d1bc45b5.png "Infrastructure & Operations") **Infrastructure & Operations**](/docs/observe/infrastructure-observability/infrastructure-and-operations "Monitor hosts, VMs, processes, and networks to detect issues and improve infrastructure performance.")).
3. Copy the hostname (for example, `exchange.mycompany.local`) from the overview.
4. Add a new resource attribute monitoring rule:

   * Set **Third-party vulnerability control** to `Monitor`.
   * Select **Add new condition** and enter the following data:

     + **Resource attribute key**: `host.name`
     + **Matcher**: `equals`
     + **Resource attribute value**: hostname from step 3.
   * Check the preview to see if the condition matches the expected processes.
   * Save the rule.

## Monitor only the Java processes on specific hosts

1. In Dynatrace, go to **Settings** > **Application Security** > **General settings** > **Third-party Vulnerability Analytics** and set **Global third-party vulnerability detection control** to **Do not monitor**.
2. Find the host on which you want to monitor processes (for example, via [![Infrastructure & Operations](https://dt-cdn.net/images/infrasctucture-operations-highresolution-1025-07d1bc45b5.png "Infrastructure & Operations") **Infrastructure & Operations**](/docs/observe/infrastructure-observability/infrastructure-and-operations "Monitor hosts, VMs, processes, and networks to detect issues and improve infrastructure performance.")).
3. Copy the hostname (for example, `exchange.mycompany.local`) from the overview.
4. Add a new resource attribute monitoring rule:

   * Set **Third-party vulnerability control** to `Monitor`.
   * To create a condition that matches the host, select **Add new condition** and enter the following data:

     + **Resource attribute key**: `host.name`
     + **Matcher**: `equals`
     + **Resource attribute value**: hostname from step 3.
   * To create a condition that matches the technology, select **Add new condition** and enter the following data:

     + **Resource attribute key**: `java.main.class`
     + **Matcher**: `exists`
   * Check the preview to see if the conditions match the expected processes.
   * Save the rule.

2. Find the process group on which you want to monitor processes (for example, via the **Technologies & Processes Classic** app).
3. Copy the process group ID (for example, `PROCESS_GROUP-0123456789ABCDEF`) from the URL.
4. Add a new resource attribute monitoring rule:

   * Set **Third-party vulnerability control** to `Monitor`.
   * Select **Add new condition** and enter the following data:

     + **Resource attribute key**: `dt.entity.process_group`
     + **Matcher**: `equals`
     + **Resource attribute value**: ID of the process group from step 3.
   * Check the preview to see if the condition matches the expected processes.
   * Save the rule.

## Monitor only processes running in a specific Kubernetes namespace

   * Save the rule.

## Monitor all Java processes except the Java demo application process on the development hosts

1. In Dynatrace, go to **Settings** > **Application Security** > **General settings** > **Third-party Vulnerability Analytics** and set **Global third-party vulnerability detection control** to **Do not monitor**.
2. Copy the fully qualified name (FQN) of the Java main class of your demo application (for example, `com.example.my.DemoMain`).
3. Find the development host on which you don't want to monitor the demo application process (for example, via [![Infrastructure & Operations](https://dt-cdn.net/images/infrasctucture-operations-highresolution-1025-07d1bc45b5.png "Infrastructure & Operations") **Infrastructure & Operations**](/docs/observe/infrastructure-observability/infrastructure-and-operations "Monitor hosts, VMs, processes, and networks to detect issues and improve infrastructure performance.")).
4. Copy the hostname (for example, `exchange.mycompany.local`) from the overview.
5. Add a new resource attribute monitoring rule to exclude the demo application process on the development host:

   * Set **Third-party vulnerability control** to `Do not monitor`.
   * To create a condition that matches the development host, select **Add new condition** and enter the following data:

     + **Resource attribute key**: `host.name`
     + **Matcher**: `equals`
     + **Resource attribute value**: hostname from step 4.
   * To create a condition that matches the demo application process, select **Add new condition** and enter the following data:

     + **Resource attribute key**: `java.main.class`
     + **Matcher**: `equals`
     + **Resource attribute value**: main class from step 2.
   * Check the preview to see if the conditions match the expected processes.
   * Save the rule.
6. Add a new resource attribute monitoring rule to monitor all remaining Java processes:

   * Set **Third-party vulnerability control** to `Monitor`.
   * To create a condition that matches the technology, select **Add new condition** and enter the following data:

     + **Resource attribute key**: `java.main.class`
     + **Matcher**: `exists`
   * Check the preview to see if the condition matches the expected processes.
   * Save the rule.

The order of the monitoring rules is important: As soon as a rule matches an entity, the entity won't be considered by any of the later rules. Consequently, **specific rules should come before general rules.**
