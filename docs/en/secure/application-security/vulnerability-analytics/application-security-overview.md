# Application Security overview

# Application Security overview

* Explanation
* Updated on Jun 17, 2025

This page refers to the classic ![Security Overview](https://dt-cdn.net/images/security-overview-512-a310b17025.png "Security Overview") **Security Overview** app, which is deprecated.  
For the latest Dynatrace experience, use the readyâmade [**Vulnerability coverage** dashboard](/docs/secure/vulnerabilities/assess-coverage "Evaluate your environment's RVA process and host coverage with the Vulnerability coverage dashboard.") to stay ahead of your vulnerability posture. It provides insights into process and host coverage, scan activity, and the evolution of vulnerability findings.

After you [set up Dynatrace Runtime Vulnerability Analytics](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics "Monitor, visualize, analyze, and remediate third-party and code-level vulnerabilities, track the remediation progress, and create monitoring rules."), Dynatrace starts monitoring your applications to detect vulnerabilities. Go to ![Security Overview](https://dt-cdn.net/images/security-overview-512-a310b17025.png "Security Overview") **Security Overview** for an overview of vulnerabilities in your global environment.

For security reasons, access to this page is restricted to users who are part of the **Security admin** group for the whole environment, not just for a selected set of management zones.

The **Application Security overview** page displays the following information.

* [A count of vulnerabilities in your environment](#info)
* [A chart of vulnerabilities by risk level](#risk-level)
* [A chart of vulnerabilities by status](#status)
* [A host coverage chart](#host-coverage)
* [Top five affected process groups](#affected-pg)
* [Technology coverage](#tech-coverage)

## Vulnerability count

### How host coverage is calculated

Host coverage is calculated based on the last 70 minutes and uses all hosts in your environment that run a supported technology.
See below the calculation mechanism for third-party and code-level vulnerabilities.

Third-party vulnerabilities

Code-level vulnerabilities

1. **Collect:** Dynatrace first collects all monitored hosts.
2. **Filter:** All monitored hosts collected are then filtered based on your [monitoring rules](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/third-party-vulnerabilities/define-monitoring-rules-tpv "Create, modify, and delete custom monitoring rules for Dynatrace-monitored processes."). If there are hosts that are excluded by monitoring rules, host coverage decreases.

* If there's a decrease in coverage, it can take up to 70 minutes until changes are displayed.
* If there's an increase in coverage, it can take up to 10 minutes until changes are displayed.

Dynatrace collects hosts based on the processes that are configured to report code-level vulnerabilities.
If at least one process is able to report code-level vulnerabilities, then its host is covered.

A process is able to report code-level vulnerabilities when

* [Code-level Vulnerability Analytics](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics#enable-clva "Monitor, visualize, analyze, and remediate third-party and code-level vulnerabilities, track the remediation progress, and create monitoring rules.") is globally enabled
* [OneAgent monitoring is enabled](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics#enable-oneagent "Monitor, visualize, analyze, and remediate third-party and code-level vulnerabilities, track the remediation progress, and create monitoring rules.")
* The [global code-level vulnerability detection control](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics#config "Monitor, visualize, analyze, and remediate third-party and code-level vulnerabilities, track the remediation progress, and create monitoring rules.") is set to `Monitor` for the technology of the given process.
* No [monitoring rules](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/code-level-vulnerabilities/define-monitoring-rules-clv "Define rules based on specific process groups") exclude the process group of the respective process from monitoring
* The process is restarted after a change in configuration

* If there's a decrease in coverage, it can take up to 70 minutes until changes are displayed.
* If there's an increase in coverage, it can take up to 10 minutes until changes are displayed.

### How to increase host coverage

To increase the host coverage for third-party and code-level vulnerabilities, follow the instructions below.

Third-party vulnerabilities

Code-level vulnerabilities

1. [Enable Third-party Vulnerability Analytics](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics#enable-tpva "Monitor, visualize, analyze, and remediate third-party and code-level vulnerabilities, track the remediation progress, and create monitoring rules.") globally.
2. Enable all the [supported technologies](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics#tech-tpv "Monitor, visualize, analyze, and remediate third-party and code-level vulnerabilities, track the remediation progress, and create monitoring rules.") that you want Dynatrace to cover. Note that only hosts running technologies that are listed and enabled can be collected.
3. In your [monitoring rules](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/third-party-vulnerabilities/define-monitoring-rules-tpv "Create, modify, and delete custom monitoring rules for Dynatrace-monitored processes."), look for hosts that are excluded from monitoring, and adapt these rules if you want the respective hosts to be collected.

1. [Enable Code-level Vulnerability Analytics](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics#enable-clva "Monitor, visualize, analyze, and remediate third-party and code-level vulnerabilities, track the remediation progress, and create monitoring rules.") globally.
2. [Enable OneAgent monitoring](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics#enable-oneagent "Monitor, visualize, analyze, and remediate third-party and code-level vulnerabilities, track the remediation progress, and create monitoring rules.").
3. Set the [global code-level vulnerability detection control](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics#config "Monitor, visualize, analyze, and remediate third-party and code-level vulnerabilities, track the remediation progress, and create monitoring rules.") to `Monitor` for all supported technologies.
4. In your [monitoring rules](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/code-level-vulnerabilities/define-monitoring-rules-clv "Define rules based on specific process groups"), look for process groups that are excluded from monitoring, and adapt these rules. Note that a host is monitored when one of its processes is monitored with Application Security.
5. Restart the process.

It can take up to 10 minutes until any change is displayed.

## Affected process groups

### How many TPVs are counted if their risk level changes?

*On the risk-level chart, how many third-party vulnerabilities are counted in one day if their risk level changes several times that day (for example, from `Medium` to `High`, and back to `Medium` again)?*

In this case, the vulnerability is counted twice, once for `Medium` and once for `High`.

### How many TPVs are counted if affected process is restarted?

*On the risk-level chart, how many third-party vulnerabilities are counted in one day if the affected process is restarted several times that day, but the vulnerability risk level stays the same (for example, `Medium`)?*

In this case, the vulnerability is counted one time, as `Medium`.
