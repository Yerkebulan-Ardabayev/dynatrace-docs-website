Dynatrace Runtime Vulnerability Analytics enables you to detect, visualize, analyze, monitor, and remediate open-source and third-party vulnerabilities, as well as the security vulnerabilities in libraries and first-party code in production and pre-production environments at runtime.

## Capabilities

* Automatic and continuous protection. Dynatrace continuously watches production and pre-production environments to identify any changes in application environments (such as container dynamics, elastic scaling, multi-version deployments, runtime container updates, rollbacks, A/B tests, or blue/green deployments) and provide precise answers about the source, nature, and severity of vulnerabilities as they arise in real time. Dynatrace automatically analyzes and prioritizes alerts.
* Continuous analysis of attack vectors to automatically track if vulnerable libraries are called and used at runtime. Dynatrace Application Security is designed to allow you to identify the most relevant vulnerabilities and reduce false positives with [Smartscape real-time topology mapping](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/smartscape-classic "Learn how Smartscape Classic visualizes all the entities and dependencies in your environment.") and distributed tracing with [PurePathÂ® code-level analysis](/docs/observe/application-observability/distributed-traces/use-cases/segment-request "Enhance your distributed system performance by segmenting requests with slow response time via Service flow and analyzing their distributed traces.").
* Runtime introspection approach in combination with [Snykï»¿](https://security.snyk.io/) and [NVDï»¿](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln), for automatic vulnerability detection at runtime. Even if security checks aren't integrated into the pipelines across all teams, or if they're deliberately bypassed, Dynatrace can detect whatâs running and pinpoint vulnerabilities instantly by automatically opening a vulnerability when one is detected, and close it when the root cause (for example, loading a vulnerable library) is no longer present.
* Full coverage across production rollbacks and outdated releases, feature flags, and deployment patterns (canary, blue/green).
* Efficient management of vulnerabilities where a fix hasn't been effective, such as if a vulnerability is accidentally reintroduced during a rollback, or if updates haven't been applied correctly.
* Precise and automatic [risk and impact assessment](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/vulnerability-evaluation#risk-asses "Explore the mechanism for generating third-party and code-level vulnerabilities in Dynatrace."), with risks prioritized by data access path and actual production execution. From hundreds or thousands of open vulnerabilities, Dynatrace Application Security is designed to pinpoint those that need immediate investigation. It automatically analyzes data access paths and production execution to provide a more precise risk and impact assessment.

## How it works

[Runtime Vulnerability Analytics (RVA)](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics "Monitor, visualize, analyze, and remediate third-party and code-level vulnerabilities, track the remediation progress, and create monitoring rules.") detects and evaluates vulnerabilities in your environment based on what's actually running, not just what's deployed. [Dynatrace OneAgent](/docs/platform/oneagent "Learn the monitoring capabilities of OneAgent.") monitors loaded libraries, runtime components, and data flows in real time. Vulnerabilities are only reported when affected components are actively used, reducing noise and false positives.

* For third-party vulnerabilities, Dynatrace:

  + Detects libraries and runtime components as they are loaded by processes.
  + Matches component names and versions against trusted vulnerability feeds.
  + Issues a vulnerability only when the component is in use.
* For code-level vulnerabilities, Dynatrace:

  + Analyzes how user input flows through the application.
  + Identifies insecure code paths that could be exploited.
  + Assesses risk based on exposure to the public internet and access to sensitive data assets.

Vulnerabilities are automatically resolved when the root cause is no longer present; for example, if a vulnerable library is removed or a process is stopped. RVA continuously adapts to topology changes and dynamic environments.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your environment meets the necessary requirements:

* You're using a supported version of Dynatrace. Review the [release notes](/docs/whats-new "Read the product news and the release notes and find out which Documentation topics are new.") for currently supported versions.
* For Runtime Vulnerability Analytics to work properly, make sure deep monitoring is enabled in **Settings** > **Process and contextualize** > **Process groups** > **Process group monitoring**.

  For .NET, Go, and Python technologies, for which automatic deep monitoring is disabled, you need to manually enable deep monitoring on each host. For more information, see [Process deep monitoring](/docs/observe/infrastructure-observability/process-groups/configuration/pg-monitoring "Ways to customize process-group monitoring").

For .NET, Go, and Python technologies, for which automatic deep monitoring is disabled, you need to manually enable deep monitoring on each host. For more information, see [Process deep monitoring](/docs/observe/infrastructure-observability/process-groups/configuration/pg-monitoring "Ways to customize process-group monitoring").

2

Java on z/OS is currently not supported.

3

Using **Webpack** or other bundlers might have an impact on automatic vulnerability detection. This is because the software components cannot be detected, as they are hidden behind the bundler configuration and not available at runtime. Only packages that are deployed as external packages can be detected and reported. For details, see [Node.js: Limitations](/docs/ingest-from/technology-support/application-software/nodejs#limitations "Read about Dynatrace support for Node.js applications.").

4

For Python vulnerabilities, Dynatrace currently supports only two states for reachable data assets: **Within range** and **Not available**.

Dynatrace detects code-level vulnerabilities in the following technologies.

| Technology | Minimum OneAgent version |
| --- | --- |
| Java 8 or higher[1](#fn-2-1-def) | 1.259 |
| .NET[2](#fn-2-2-def)'[3](#fn-2-3-def) | 1.289 |
| Go[3](#fn-2-3-def) | 1.311 |

1

Only supported on Windows x86 and Linux x86 systems.

2

Only .NET Framework 4.5, .NET Core 3.0 or higher, and 64-bit processes are supported.

3

For .NET and Go technologies, for which automatic deep monitoring is disabled, you need to manually enable deep monitoring on each host. For more information, see [Process deep monitoring](/docs/observe/infrastructure-observability/process-groups/configuration/pg-monitoring "Ways to customize process-group monitoring").

Code-level vulnerability detection for backends that use database ORMs is also supported.

## Get started

* Third-party vulnerability detection helps you identify open-source and third-party vulnerabilities in production and pre-production environments at runtime. To monitor third-party vulnerabilities, [enable third-party vulnerability detection](#tpv-detection).
* Code-level vulnerability detection leverages code inspection at runtime to identify vulnerabilities in libraries and first-party code. To monitor code-level vulnerabilities, [enable code-level vulnerability detection](#clv-detection).

Enable third-party vulnerability detection

Enable code-level vulnerability detection

OneAgent version 1.239+

1. Enable Third-party Vulnerability Analytics

Go to **Settings** > **Analyze and alert** > **Application security** > **General settings** > **Third-party Vulnerability Analytics** and select **Enable Third-party Vulnerability Analytics**.

2. Configure the global third-party vulnerability detection control

To define the default third-party vulnerability detection control for all processes and Kubernetes nodes

Go to **Settings** > **Analyze and alert** > **Application security** > **General settings** > **Third-party vulnerability Analytics** and select one of the **Global third-party vulnerability detection control** modes:

* **Monitor**âThird-party vulnerabilities are reported.
* **Do not monitor**âThird-party vulnerabilities are ignored.

You can also define [custom monitoring rules](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/third-party-vulnerabilities/define-monitoring-rules-tpv "Create, modify, and delete custom monitoring rules for Dynatrace-monitored processes.") based on certain criteria. In this case, the default monitoring mode applies to all processes and Kubernetes nodes that are not matched by a rule.

3. Control by technology

Optional

After you enable Third-party Vulnerability Analytics, Dynatrace starts generating vulnerabilities for all [supported technologies](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics#tech-tpv "Monitor, visualize, analyze, and remediate third-party and code-level vulnerabilities, track the remediation progress, and create monitoring rules.") by default. To control which of these technologies should receive vulnerabilities

1. Go to **Settings** > **Analyze and alert** > **Application security** > **General settings** > **Third-party Vulnerability Analytics** and enable or disable technologies as needed.

   Runtime technologies (for example, Java, Node.js, and .NET runtimes) are tied to the corresponding main technology (for example, Java and Node.js). If the main technology is disabled, the corresponding runtime technology is automatically disabled. If you enable the main technology, enabling the corresponding runtime technology is optional.
2. Select **Save changes**.

4. Enable monitoring for Python

This step is required only to monitor vulnerabilities in Python technology.

1. Enable Dynatrace monitoring for Python: In **Settings** > **Collect and capture** > **General monitoring settings** > **Monitoring technologies**, find **Python** and enable **Monitor Python**.
2. Enable OneAgent monitoring: In **Settings** > **Collect and capture** > **General monitoring settings** > **OneAgent features**, find and enable **Python software component reporting**, then restart your processes.

5. Enable OneAgent monitoring for Java vulnerable functions

Optional

To enable OneAgent monitoring for Java vulnerable functions

1. In **Settings** > **Collect and capture** > **General monitoring settings** > **OneAgent features**, find and enable **Java vulnerable function reporting**.
2. Select **Save changes**.
3. Restart your processes.

For more information about function usage, see [Vulnerable functions](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/third-party-vulnerabilities/manage-third-party-vulnerabilities#vuln-functions "Monitor the security issues of your third-party libraries.").

OneAgent version 1.259+

1. Enable Code-level Vulnerability Analytics

1. Go to **Settings** > **Analyze and alert** > **Application security** > **General settings** > **Code-level Vulnerability Analytics** and select **Enable Code-level Vulnerability Analytics**.
2. Restart your processes.

Code-level Vulnerability Analytics is designed to carry a production-ready performance footprint. The overhead depends on your application but should be negligible in most cases.

2. Configure the global code-level vulnerability detection control

To define the default code-level vulnerability detection control for all process groups

1. Go to **Settings** > **Analyze and alert** > **Application security** > **General settings** > **Code-level Vulnerability Analytics** and select the global code-level vulnerability detection control per technology:

   * **Monitor** â Code-level vulnerabilities in the selected technology are reported.
   * **Do not monitor** â Code-level vulnerabilities in the selected technology are ignored.

You can also define [custom monitoring rules](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/code-level-vulnerabilities/define-monitoring-rules-clv "Define rules based on specific process groups") based on certain process groups. In this case, custom rules override the global detection control for the selected technology, and Runtime Vulnerability Analytics continues to monitor the code-level vulnerabilities based on your rules.

2. Select **Save changes**.
3. Restart your processes.

3. Enable OneAgent monitoring

1. Go to **Settings** > **Collect and capture** > **General monitoring settings** > **OneAgent features**.
2. Filter by `code-level vulnerability evaluation` and enable the feature for the technologies you want to monitor.
3. Select **Save changes**.
4. Restart your processes.

OneAgent version 1.309 To detect SSRF code-level vulnerabilities, you also need to enable SSRF code-level vulnerability evaluation. See below for instructions.

1. Go to **Settings** > **Collect and capture** > **General monitoring settings** > **OneAgent features**.
2. Find and enable `Java SSRF code-level vulnerability and attack evaluation`.
3. Select **Save changes**.
4. Restart your processes.

## What's next

After you enable third-party and code-level vulnerability detection, you can

* Improve your environment's security by quickly addressing vulnerabilities and remediation actions with [![Vulnerabilities](https://dt-cdn.net/images/vulnerabilities-highresolution-1025-9279da9743.png "Vulnerabilities") **Vulnerabilities**](/docs/secure/vulnerabilities "Prioritize and efficiently manage vulnerabilities in your monitored environments.").
* Set up [monitoring rules for third-party vulnerabilities](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/third-party-vulnerabilities/define-monitoring-rules-tpv "Create, modify, and delete custom monitoring rules for Dynatrace-monitored processes.") and [monitoring rules for code-level vulnerabilities](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/code-level-vulnerabilities/define-monitoring-rules-clv "Define rules based on specific process groups").
* Verify monitoring scope and exposure trends with the [**Vulnerability coverage** dashboard](/docs/secure/vulnerabilities/assess-coverage "Evaluate your environment's RVA process and host coverage with the Vulnerability coverage dashboard.").
