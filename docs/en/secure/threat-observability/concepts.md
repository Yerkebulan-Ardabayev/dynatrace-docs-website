* Updated on Jan 28, 2026

This section aims to give you a better understanding of data in the security context so you can easily accomplish various [use cases](#usecase) with security-related data available on [Grail](/docs/platform/grail "Insights on what and how you can query Dynatrace data."). To learn how DQL can help in your daily tasks, see [DQL examples for security data](#examples).

## Types of data in Grail

Data can be ingested in Grail from your monitored environment or from third-party sources.

Data from your monitored environment

Data from third-party sources

Data that Dynatrace collects from your monitored environment and that can be currently queried in Grail consists of:

* [Security events](#security-events)
* [Logs](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/logs "Log Management and Analytics provides a unified approach to controlling and studying your log data in Dynatrace.")
* [Metrics](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/metrics/built-in-metrics-on-grail "Get to know the equivalents of the classic built-in metrics supported on Grail.")
* [Entities](/docs/platform/grail/querying-monitored-entities "Find out how to query monitored entities in Grail.")
* [Dynatrace Intelligence problems and events](/docs/dynatrace-intelligence/root-cause-analysis/event-analysis-and-correlation "Gain an understanding of the Events section on each host, process, and service overview page.")
* [System events](/docs/platform/upgrade#system-data "Use the power of Grail, AppEngine, and AutomationEngine to take advantage of improvements in storing and analyzing observability and security data.")
* [Business events](/docs/observe/business-observability/bo-basic-concepts#business-event "Basic concepts of Dynatrace Business Observability.")

For details, see

* [Data in Grail](/docs/platform/upgrade#data-in-grail "Use the power of Grail, AppEngine, and AutomationEngine to take advantage of improvements in storing and analyzing observability and security data.")
* [Grail data model](/docs/platform/grail/organize-data "Insights on the Grail data model consisting of buckets, tables, and views.")

Dynatrace consumes data from third-party sources, providing consolidated, unified analysis and automation.

For a list of supported integrations, see [Security events ingest](/docs/secure/threat-observability/security-events-ingest "Ingest external security data into Grail.").

## Security-related data

Security-related data can be either generated by Dynatrace native capabilities and collected by [OneAgent](/docs/platform/oneagent "Learn the monitoring capabilities of OneAgent.") or [ActiveGate](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate "Understand the basic concepts related to ActiveGate."), or ingested from third-party tools via [log ingestion](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/logs "Log Management and Analytics provides a unified approach to controlling and studying your log data in Dynatrace.") or [OpenPipeline](/docs/platform/openpipeline "Scale Dynatrace platform data handling with Dynatrace OpenPipeline.").

Security-related data on Grail can provide you answers with different granularity and from various perspectives. You can query, aggregate, visualize, and report data on multiple levels.

The Grail data lakehouse doesn't distinguish security-related data from observability information. You can use all your data in Dynatrace for your security use cases. For example, if you ingested your application authentication logs for business purposes, you can use the same logs to detect potential [brute force attacksï»¿](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/) on your customer accounts.
Below are some examples of how you can use data for security purposes:

* [Context-aware security incident response with Dynatrace Automations and Tetragonï»¿](https://dt-url.net/he03pmt)
* [Overseeing SaaS security with AWS AppFabric and Dynatraceï»¿](https://dt-url.net/mj23pnk)
* [Detect VMware Aria Operations for Logs exploitation with Dynatrace and DQLï»¿](https://dt-url.net/t203p6a)
* [TTP-based threat hunting with Dynatrace Security Analytics and Falco Alerts solves alert noiseï»¿](https://dt-url.net/j903pdg)
* [Log forensics: Finding malicious activity in multicloud environments with Dynatrace Grailï»¿](https://dt-url.net/dz03pqc)

## Security events

This section has been updated to align with the new Grail security events table. For the complete list of updates and actions needed to accomplish the migration, follow the steps in the [Grail security table migration guide](/docs/secure/threat-observability/migration "Understand the changes in the new Grail security table and learn how to migrate to it.").

Security events are a type of [security-related data](#security-data) consisting of various generated events such as

* [Vulnerability events](#vuln-events)
* [Compliance events](#compliance)
* [Detection finding events](#detection)

### Storage

* Security events generated by Dynatrace from your monitored environment are stored in the `default_securityevents_builtin` bucket for **three years**.
* Security events ingested from third-party sources are stored in the `default_securityevents` bucket for **one year**.
* The original (raw) data ingested is stored in `dt.raw_data`. You can query it with a [parse command](/docs/platform/grail/dynatrace-query-language/commands/extraction-and-parsing-commands "DQL extraction commands"), for example:

  ```
  fetch security.events



  | parse dt.raw_data, """JSON:dt.raw_data"""



  | filter isNotNull(dt.raw_data[vulnerability.title])



  | fields dt.raw_data[vulnerability.title]
  ```

### Permissions

* `storage:security.events:read` (to query ingested security events)
* `storage:logs:read` (to query ingested logs)

## Vulnerability events

Vulnerability events can be classified by event levels (`event.level`), event groups (`event.group_label`), and event types (`event.type`). See below for details.

**Event levels**

| Event levels | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `VULNERABILITY` | The vulnerability on the global level, including general information, global statuses, and changes. The unique identifier is `vulnerability.id` or `vulnerability.display_id`. |
| `ENTITY` | The vulnerable entity with vulnerability-related information scoped to the entity. The unique identifier is a tuple of (`affected_entity.id`, `vulnerability.id`). |

**Event groups**

| Event groups | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `CHANGE_EVENT` | Change that occurs on a vulnerability or its affected entity. |
| `STATE_REPORT` | The full historical state of a vulnerability or its affected entity and is reported periodically over time: `OPEN` (muted and not muted) vulnerabilities are reported every 15 minutes; `RESOLVED` vulnerabilities are reported only once (when open vulnerabilities get resolved). To analyze resolved vulnerabilities, filter for the desired time range. |

**Event types**

| Event types | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `VULNERABILITY_STATE_REPORT_EVENT` | Historical vulnerability states reported periodically. |
| `VULNERABILITY_COVERAGE_REPORT_EVENT` | Historical coverage events reported periodically. |
| `VULNERABILITY_STATUS_CHANGE_EVENT` | Vulnerability status changes reported on change. These include resolution and mute statuses. |
| `VULNERABILITY_ASSESSMENT_CHANGE_EVENT` | Vulnerability assessment changes reported on change. These include the Dynatrace Security Score and Dynatrace Assessment. |
| `VULNERABILITY_FINDING`[1](#fn-1-1-def) | A single vulnerability identified in a specific process at a given time. |
| `VULNERABILITY_SCAN`[1](#fn-1-1-def) | The analysis of detected packages within a specific process at a given time. |

This event type can be ingested both from [third-party security tools](/docs/secure/threat-observability/security-events-ingest "Ingest external security data into Grail.") and from [third-party libraries used by Dynatrace-monitored processes](/docs/secure/vulnerabilities/concepts#tpv-events "Concepts that are specific to the Dynatrace Vulnerabilities app.").

For a list of vulnerability event fields mapped to Grail, see [Dynatrace Semantic Dictionary](/docs/semantic-dictionary/model/security-events "Get to know the Semantic Dictionary models related to security events.").

### Vulnerability findings

Use ![Vulnerabilities](https://dt-cdn.net/images/vulnerabilities-highresolution-1025-9279da9743.png "Vulnerabilities") **Vulnerabilities** to [analyze, prioritize, and efficiently manage findings](/docs/secure/vulnerabilities/explore-findings "View, filter, and analyze vulnerability findings from Dynatrace and external security tools.") in your monitored environments.

A vulnerability finding is a security event that highlights a detected weakness in a system, software component, or environment. It represents a single instance of a flaw or misconfiguration that could be exploited.

Each finding is stored as an individual event at the time it is detected. These records may come from external sources such as thirdâparty scanners or libraries used by Dynatraceâmonitored processes. Dynatrace ingests and stores these events as raw data but does not perform additional analysis (for example, no Dynatrace Security Score is calculated).

Findings include details such as:

* Severity and risk level
* Affected component and remediation status
* Metadata (timestamps, unique IDs, and source information)
* Technical attributes (CVSS scores, exploit availability, and CVE references)

## Compliance events

A compliance event is a type of security event specific to the [Security Posture Management capability](/docs/secure/application-security/spm "Assess, manage, and take action on misconfigurations and violations against security hardening guidelines and regulatory compliance standards."). It represents the assessment of a resource in the context of the rule specified in the compliance standard.

| Event types | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `COMPLIANCE_SCAN_COMPLETED` | A compliance scan completed event is generated when a scan of a configuration dataset against compliance rules is completed. |
| `COMPLIANCE_FINDING` | A compliance finding event is generated when an object is evaluated against a compliance rule during a scan. The event contains the results of this evaluation and the compliance status of the given object. |

For a list of compliance event fields mapped to Grail, see [Dynatrace Semantic Dictionary](/docs/semantic-dictionary/model/security-events#compliance-finding-events "Get to know the Semantic Dictionary models related to security events.").

## Detection finding events

A detection finding event is generated when suspicious activity is observed around an object. The event contains all information available and deemed useful at the moment of detection.

Use [![Threats & Exploits](https://dt-cdn.net/images/attacks-512-b922840b12.png "Threats & Exploits") **Threats & Exploits**](/docs/secure/threats-and-exploits "Understand, triage, and investigate detection findings and alerts.") to evaluate, triage, and investigate detection findings.

| Event types | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `DETECTION_FINDING` | An alert or detection generated by security tools using correlation algorithms, detection rules, or other analytical methods. |

To retrieve detection finding events, use a query such as the following:

```
fetch security.events



| filter event.kind == "SECURITY_EVENT" AND event.type == "DETECTION_FINDING"



| filter product.name == "Runtime Application Protection"



| makeTimeseries count()
```

For a list of detection finding event fields mapped to Grail, see [Dynatrace Semantic Dictionary](/docs/semantic-dictionary/model/security-events#detection-finding-events "Get to know the Semantic Dictionary models related to security events.").

## OpenPipeline integration

With [OpenPipeline](/docs/platform/openpipeline "Scale Dynatrace platform data handling with Dynatrace OpenPipeline."), you can ingest external security events from multiple third-party products into [Grail](/docs/platform/grail "Insights on what and how you can query Dynatrace data.") and operationalize your data on the Dynatrace platform.

**Out-of-the-box integrations**

Dynatrace provides seamless OpenPipeline integration options for specific technologies. Ingested data is automatically stored in [Grail](/docs/platform/grail "Insights on what and how you can query Dynatrace data.") and mapped to the [Dynatrace Semantic Dictionary unified formatï»¿](https://dt-url.net/3q03pb0).
We provide ready-made dashboards and workflows to help you visualize data and automatize notifications. For a practical example, see [Visualize and analyze security findings use case](/docs/secure/use-cases/visualize-and-analyze-security-findings "Visualize, prioritize, and analyze ingested security findings.").

**Support for custom ingestion**

You can use our built-in security events API endpoint or create a custom API endpoint to ingest any kind of security events from any third-party system into Grail. You can [configure a pipelineï»¿](https://dt-url.net/k203p5t) to manually map your data to the [Semantic Dictionary conventionsï»¿](https://dt-url.net/3q03pb0).
Once your events comply with the Semantic Dictionary, you can leverage the dashboards and workflows provided by other integrations to view, analyze, and automate those findings alongside existing security data.

## Severity and score normalization

When findings are ingested from different vulnerability sources, Dynatrace distinguishes between the values reported by the provider and the normalized values used across the platform. Normalization ensures that all findings can be consistently compared and prioritized, regardless of their origin.

* **Ingested severity**: Severity level reported by the original vendor or scanner. The severity level is stored in the `finding.severity` field.
* **Normalized severity**: Severity mapped to a unified Dynatrace risk scale (`dt.security.risk.level`) to ensure consistency across products.
* **Ingested risk score**: Risk score defined by the provider (for example, Dynatrace Security Score). When provided by the source tool, the ingested risk score is stored in the `finding.score` field.
* **Normalized risk score**: Risk score converted to a unified Dynatrace scale (`dt.security.risk.score`) so you can consistently crossâprioritize vulnerabilities.

Each finding also specifies the product (`product.name` and `product.vendor`) that detected it (for example, Runtime Vulnerability Analytics), so you can identify the source of the data.
