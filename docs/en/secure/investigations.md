About the app

### What you'll learn

* Define and execute queries while combining functionalities.
* Search for relevant log information.
* Grasp structured information from log records.
* Extract fields and get instant feedback on patterns.
* Track your path, navigate to previous steps, view your investigation history.
* Define the time range for your data queries.
* Attach relevant findings as evidence, while preserving the investigation context.
* Add reputation context to IP addresses with [IP enrichment](/docs/secure/investigations/enhance-results#enrich "Organize and interpret query outputs across investigations --- from performance analysis to threat detection.") powered by third-party threat intelligence.
* Collaborate with peers on investigations using controlled access.
* Interact with compatible apps for further insights.
* Create and use [lookup tables](/docs/secure/investigations/enhance-results#lookup "Organize and interpret query outputs across investigations --- from performance analysis to threat detection.") to enrich investigations with contextual data.

### Target audience
