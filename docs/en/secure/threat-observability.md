# Threat Observability

* Latest Dynatrace
* Overview
* Updated on Feb 26, 2026

In a world where security data is constantly increasing in scale, DevSecOps teams find themselves lost in siloed tooling, overwhelmed by the number of alerts. This leads to missed threats and increased security risks. A lot of manual effort is required to assemble all the puzzle pieces and act on the security findings.

Dynatrace Threat Observability offers a platform that unifies and enriches the security data with the runtime context. This helps to break the informational siloes between various tools and environments and contributes to efficient risk mitigation.

Leveraging Grail and DQL, you can uniformly consume Dynatrace-generated and third-party security findings, enabling multiple use cases that contribute to:

* Findings prioritization with runtime context
* Security data visualization and reporting
* Automation of ticket creation and notifications
* Security investigation and threat hunting
* Threat detection and remediation

With a wide range of security integrations and OpenPipeline ingest, the Dynatrace observability and security platform interoperates with your ecosystem of products, providing more significant value from the generated data.
