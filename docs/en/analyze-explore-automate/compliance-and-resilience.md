By leveraging Dynatrace unified observability and security, you can automate up to 80% of the technical tasks necessary for managing compliance and resilience at scale. This approach addresses the dynamic global regulatory requirements for operational resilience, emphasizing the growing reliance on secure, resilient, and dependable IT environments

## The importance of resilience in a complex regulatory landscape

In today's digital age, operational resilience is paramount for businesses striving to maintain seamless operations and safeguard their reputation. The ability to quickly react to incidents is no longer sufficient; organizations must proactively prevent issues and manage risks to ensure continuous service delivery. This need is amplified by an increasingly complex regulatory and compliance landscape, where global standards demand stringent measures to protect data, ensure service continuity, and mitigate risks.

Navigating these regulations while maintaining high performance and security standards is challenging. Non-compliance can lead to operational disruptions, severe penalties, and reputational damage. Therefore, achieving operational resilience is not just about compliance; it's about ensuring long-term sustainability and protecting the business against potential threats.

## Dynatrace: your partner in compliance and resilience

Compliance and resilience capabilities leverage the industry-leading Dynatrace platform for unified observability and security, including the [Compliance Assistantï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/hub/detail/compliance-assistant/) ![Compliance Assistant](https://dt-cdn.net/images/compliance-assistant-app-256-a136b783a7.png "Compliance Assistant") app for DORA compliance. They offer a comprehensive end-to-end solution to these challenges, providing functionalities designed to enhance compliance and resilience in IT environments. Here's how Dynatrace can help automate up to 80% of the technical tasks required to manage compliance and resilience:

* Understand the complexity of IT systems in real time
* Proactively prevent, prioritize, and efficiently manage performance and security incidents
* Automate manual and routine tasks to increase your productivity

## Step 1 Understand the complexity of IT systems in real time

Dynatrace helps you comprehensively map the entire IT environment in real time. It gives you visibility into which components are monitored and which are not, and helps automate time-consuming compliance configuration checks.

### Discovery & Coverage

[Discovery & Coverage](/docs/ingest-from/discovery-coverage-app "Discover and remediate monitoring coverage gaps at scale.") ![Discovery & Coverage](https://dt-cdn.net/images/discovery-coverage-256-a20d5afa78.png "Discovery & Coverage") helps prevent unexpected outages by detecting and remediating monitoring coverage gaps across your entire enterprise.
