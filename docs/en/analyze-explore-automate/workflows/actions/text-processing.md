Text Processing provides `set` and `get` actions, which you can use to create, modify, or retrieve properties from JSON or YAML content.
The YAML actions support multi-document YAML files through an optional document index parameter.

You can combine the Text Processing actions with other Connector actions, for example, with [GitHub Connector action](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/workflows/actions/github "Integrate Workflows with GitHub for handling common developer tasks.") or [GitLab Connector action](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/workflows/actions/gitlab "Integrate Workflows with GitLab.") to fetch JSON or YAML files from a repository/project, manipulate them with the Text Processing Connector actions, and update them via a pull request or merge request.

For more information on how to start a workflow to use Text Processing, see [Workflows quick start guide](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/workflows/quickstart "Build and run your first workflow.").
