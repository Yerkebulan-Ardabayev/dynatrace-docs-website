To access various **Live** or **Draft** workflow management commands

1. Go to ![Workflows](https://dt-cdn.net/images/workflows-1024-b5708f3cf9.webp "Workflows") **Workflows**.
2. Find the workflow.
3. Select either **Edit in draft** or **Switch to live**.
4. Next to the **Switch to live** button, open to the  menu.
5. Select a command.

   * **Workflow**âsee [Download a workflow or template](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/workflows/manage-workflows/workflows-download#download-workflow "Download your workflow or your existing workflow as a template for an easy backup, to use locally or to share it to upload on a different tenant.")
   * **Template**âsee [Download a workflow or template](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/workflows/manage-workflows/workflows-download#download-workflow-template "Download your workflow or your existing workflow as a template for an easy backup, to use locally or to share it to upload on a different tenant.")
   * **Compare draft changes**âcompare the **Draft**to any the **Live** version of the workflow.
   * **Undeploy workflow**âthe workflow becomes draft only, any existing **Draft** will be replaced. It won't be triggered automatically anymore.
   * **Delete draft**âdeletes only the **Draft** of the workflow.
