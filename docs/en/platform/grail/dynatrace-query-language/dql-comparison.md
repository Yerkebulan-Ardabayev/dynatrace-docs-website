# DQL compared to SQL and more

This page compares the most common use cases between DQL and other well-established data query and processing languages like SQL, Splunk's SPL, and Microsoft's Kusto Query Language.

### Loading data for querying

#### Dynatrace Query Language (DQL)

```
fetch events
```

#### Structured Query Language (SQL)

```
SELECT * FROM events
```

#### Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL)

```
sourcetype = event*
```

#### Kusto Query Language (KQL)

```
events
```

### Filtering

Narrows the number of records based on a filter expression. In this example, we are searching for payment events.

#### Dynatrace Query Language (DQL)

```
fetch events



| filter event.type == "travel.funnel.booking-payment"
```

#### Structured Query Language (SQL)

```
SELECT * FROM events WHERE 'event.type'="travel.funnel.booking-payment"
```

#### Splunk Search Processing language (SPL)

```
sourcetype = event* | where event.type = "travel.funnel.booking-payment"
```

#### Kusto Query Language (KQL)

```
events



| where ['event.type'] == "travel.funnel.booking-payment"
```

We can add as many filters as needed to the pipeline. For example, we can look for bookings made by higher level loyalty customers traveling with children.

#### Dynatrace Query Language (DQL)

```
fetch events



| filter event.type == "travel.funnel.booking-payment" and loyaltyStatus == "Platinum" and childrenTravelers > 0
```

#### Structured Query Language (SQL)

```
SELECT * FROM events WHERE 'event.type'="travel.funnel.booking-payment" AND loyaltyStatus = "Platinum" AND childrenTravelers > 0
```

#### Splunk Search Processing language (SPL)

```
sourcetype = event*



| where event.type = "travel.funnel.booking-payment" AND loyaltyStatus = "Platinum" AND childrenTravelers > 0
```

#### Kusto Query Language (KQL)

```
events



| where ['event.type'] == "travel.funnel.booking-payment" and loyaltyStatus == "Platinum" and childrenTravelers > 0
```

### Field selection

Selecting just the relevant fields can be done in any pipeline stage. In this example, we will select only the product of successful bookings.

#### Dynatrace Query Language (DQL)

```
fetch events



| filter event.type == "travel.funnel.booking-payment"



| fields product
```

#### Structured Query Language (SQL)

```
SELECT product FROM events WHERE 'event.type'="travel.funnel.booking-payment"
```

#### Splunk Search Processing language (SPL)

```
sourcetype = event*



| where event.type = "travel.funnel.booking-payment"



| fields product
```

#### Kusto Query Language (KQL)

```
event



| where ['event.type'] == "travel.funnel.booking-payment"



| project product
```

### Calculations and sorting

We can transform the selected records in the pipelines. For example, we select the booked trips' duration in days and we will turn it into weeks.

#### Dynatrace Query Language (DQL)

```
fetch event



| filter event.type == "travel.funnel.booking-payment"



| fieldsAdd journeyWeeks = journeyDuration/7



| sort journeyWeeks desc
```

#### Structured Query Language (SQL)

```
SELECT journeyDuration/7 AS journeyWeeks FROM events WHERE 'event.type'="travel.funnel.booking-payment" ORDER BY journeyWeeks DESC
```

#### Splunk Search Processing language (SPL)

```
sourcetype = event*



| where event.type = "travel.funnel.booking-payment"



| eval journeyweeks = journeyDuration/7



| sort -journeyweeks
```

#### Kusto Query Language (KQL)

```
event



| where ['event.type'] == "travel.funnel.booking-payment"



| project journeyWeeks = journeyDuration/7



| sort journeyweeks desc
```

### Grouping

If we are interested only in unique values in our key, we can deduplicate the results by grouping them.

#### Dynatrace Query Language (DQL)

```
fetch events



| summarize count(), by:event.type



| fields event.type
```

#### Structured Query Language (SQL)

```
SELECT DISTINCT 'event.type' FROM events
```

#### Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL)

```
sourcetype = event*



| stats count by event.type
```

#### Kusto Query Language (KQL)

```
events



| summarize by event.type
```

### Aggregation

After grouping selected records based on a field, we can aggregate the results to a new output.

#### Dynatrace Query Language (DQL)

```
fetch events



| filter event.type == "travel.funnel.booking-payment"



| summarize sum = sum(amount), by:travelAgency
```

#### Structured Query Language (SQL)

```
SELECT sum(amount) AS sum FROM events GROUP BY sum, travelAgency WHERE 'event.type' == "travel.funnel.booking-payment"
```

#### Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL)

```
sourcetype = event*



| where event.type = "travel.funnel.booking-payment"



| stats sum(amount) as total_amount by travelAgency
```

#### Kusto Query Language (KQL)

```
event



| filter event.type == "travel.funnel.booking-payment"



| summarize sum = sum(amount) by travelAgency
```

Let's take a look at a bit more complex use case, where we want to add a new field, based on a mathematical expression, to our result table.

#### Dynatrace Query Language (DQL)

```
fetch events



| filter event.type == "travel.funnel.booking-payment"



| summarize sum = sum(amount), by:{travelAgency, travelers}



| fieldsAdd has_more_than_2 = travelers > 2
```

#### Structured Query Language (SQL)

```
SELECT sum(amount) AS sum, travelers > 2  AS has_more_than_2 FROM events  GROUP BY sum, has_more_than_2, travelAgency, travelers WHERE 'event.type' == "travel.funnel.booking-payment"
```

#### Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL)

```
sourcetype = event*



| where event.type = "travel.funnel.booking-payment"



| stats sum(amount) as total_amount by travelAgency, travelers



| eval has_more_than_2 = travelers > 2
```

#### Kusto Query Language (KQL)

```
events



| where ['event.type'] == "travel.funnel.booking-payment"



| summarize sumBytes = sum(amount) by travelAgency, travelers



| project has_more_than_2 = travelers > 2
```
