# Monitored entities API - security context

# Monitored entities API - security context

* Reference
* Updated on Jun 06, 2025
* Deprecated

This API is deprecated. Use the [Management zones](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/settings/schemas/builtin-management-zones "View builtin:management-zones settings schema table of your monitoring environment via the Dynatrace API.") schema (`builtin:management-zones`) of the Settings API instead.

Create or delete security context for monitored entities.

Matching entities will have a management zone assigned if the given security context matches the name of an already existing management zone. This endpoint does not create a new management zone if there is no management zone with the provided name.

Management zone rules will not apply to entities with a set security context. To be able to apply them again, you need to delete the security context.

For more information on security context, see [Grant access to entities with security context](/docs/manage/identity-access-management/use-cases/access-security-context "Grant access to entities with security context").

## Create the security context

The request consumes and produces an `application/json` payload.

|  |  |  |

| POST | SaaS | `https://{your-environment-id}.live.dynatrace.com/api/v2/entities/securityContext` |
| POST | Environment ActiveGateCluster ActiveGate | `https://{your-activegate-domain}:9999/e/{your-environment-id}/api/v2/entities/securityContext` |

## Authentication

To execute this request, you need an access token with `settings.write` scope.

To learn how to obtain and use it, see [Tokens and authentication](/docs/discover-dynatrace/references/dynatrace-api/basics/dynatrace-api-authentication).

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | In | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| entitySelector | string | Defines the scope of the entities to set the security context for. Only entities that can have management zones are considered for this operation  You must set one of these criteria:  * Entity type: `type("TYPE")` * Dynatrace entity ID: `entityId("id")`. You can specify several IDs, separated by a comma (`entityId("id-1","id-2")`). All requested entities must be of the same type.  You can add one or more of the following criteria. Values are case-sensitive and the `EQUALS` operator is used unless otherwise specified.  * Tag: `tag("value")`. Tags in `[context]key:value`, `key:value`, and `value` formats are detected and parsed automatically. Any colons (`:`) that are part of the key or value must be escaped with a backslash(`\`). Otherwise, it will be interpreted as the separator between the key and the value. All tag values are case-sensitive. * Management zone ID: `mzId(123)` * Management zone name: `mzName("value")` * Entity name: + `entityName.equals`: performs a non-casesensitive `EQUALS` query.   + `entityName.startsWith`: changes the operator to `BEGINS WITH`.   + `entityName.in`: enables you to provide multiple values. The `EQUALS` operator applies.   + `caseSensitive(entityName.equals("value"))`: takes any entity name criterion as an argument and makes the value case-sensitive. * Health state (HEALTHY,UNHEALTHY): `healthState("HEALTHY")` * First seen timestamp: `firstSeenTms.<operator>(now-3h)`. Use any timestamp format from the **from**/**to** parameters.   The following operators are available: + `lte`: earlier than or at the specified time   + `lt`: earlier than the specified time   + `gte`: later than or at the specified time   + `gt`: later than the specified time * Entity attribute: `<attribute>("value1","value2")` and `<attribute>.exists()`. To fetch the list of available attributes, execute the [GET entity typeï»¿](https://dt-url.net/2ka3ivt) request and check the **properties** field of the response. * Relationships: `fromRelationships.<relationshipName>()` and `toRelationships.<relationshipName>()`. This criterion takes an entity selector as an attribute. To fetch the list of available relationships, execute the [GET entity typeï»¿](https://dt-url.net/2ka3ivt) request and check the **fromRelationships** and **toRelationships** fields. * Negation: `not(<criterion>)`. Inverts any criterion except for **type**.  For more information, see [Entity selectorï»¿](https://dt-url.net/apientityselector) in Dynatrace Documentation.  To set several criteria, separate them with a comma (`,`). For example, `type("HOST"),healthState("HEALTHY")`. Only results matching **all** criteria are included in the response.  The maximum string length is 2,000 characters. | query | Required |
| from | string | The start of the requested timeframe.  You can use one of the following formats:  * Timestamp in UTC milliseconds. * Human-readable format of `2021-01-25T05:57:01.123+01:00`. If no time zone is specified, UTC is used. You can use a space character instead of the `T`. Seconds and fractions of a second are optional. * Relative timeframe, back from now. The format is `now-NU/A`, where `N` is the amount of time, `U` is the unit of time, and `A` is an alignment. The alignment rounds all the smaller values to the nearest zero in the past. For example, `now-1y/w` is one year back, aligned by a week.   You can also specify relative timeframe without an alignment: `now-NU`.   Supported time units for the relative timeframe are: + `m`: minutes   + `h`: hours   + `d`: days   + `w`: weeks   + `M`: months   + `y`: years  If not set, the relative timeframe of three days is used (`now-3d`). | query | Optional |
| to | string | The end of the requested timeframe.  You can use one of the following formats:  * Timestamp in UTC milliseconds. * Human-readable format of `2021-01-25T05:57:01.123+01:00`. If no time zone is specified, UTC is used. You can use a space character instead of the `T`. Seconds and fractions of a second are optional. * Relative timeframe, back from now. The format is `now-NU/A`, where `N` is the amount of time, `U` is the unit of time, and `A` is an alignment. The alignment rounds all the smaller values to the nearest zero in the past. For example, `now-1y/w` is one year back, aligned by a week.   You can also specify relative timeframe without an alignment: `now-NU`.   Supported time units for the relative timeframe are: + `m`: minutes   + `h`: hours   + `d`: days   + `w`: weeks   + `M`: months   + `y`: years  If not set, the current timestamp is used. | query | Optional |
