Adaptive Traffic Management is the intelligent sampling mechanism used in Dynatrace. It ensures trace data captured by OneAgent doesn't exceed the trace volume included with Full-Stack monitoring, while maintaining a statistically valid dataset.

[### Adaptive Traffic Management concepts

Understand different terms related to Adaptive Traffic Management, such as **Full-Stack included trace volume** or **adaptive trace sampling rate**.](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-oneagent/adaptive-traffic-management/adaptive-traffic-management-concepts "Basic concepts related to Adaptive Traffic Management.")[### Adaptive Traffic Management for Dynatrace Platform Subscription (DPS)

Discover Adaptive Traffic Management for Dynatrace Platform Subscription (DPS) and learn how to monitor, increase, or decrease the trace data capture rate. With Dynatrace Platform Subscription (DPS), you can extend trace ingest for Full-Stack to increase the trace capture rate. This requires your explicit opt-in. In its default configuration Adaptive Traffic Management guarantees that no extend trace ingest is being charged.](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-oneagent/adaptive-traffic-management/adaptive-traffic-management-saas-dps "Learn how Adaptive Traffic Management works with Dynatrace Platform Subscription (DPS) and how it manages trace sampling for Full-Stack monitored hosts and applications.")[### Adaptive Traffic Management for Dynatrace classic license
