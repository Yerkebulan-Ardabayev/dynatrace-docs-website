* Published Jul 06, 2020

Dynatrace ingests metrics for multiple preselected namespaces, including AWS Elemental MediaPackage (Live, Video on Demand). You can view metrics for each service instance, split metrics into multiple dimensions, and create custom charts that you can pin to your dashboards.

## Prerequisites

To enable monitoring for this service, you need

* An Environment or Cluster ActiveGate version 1.197+
* For AWS Elemental MediaPackage Live, Dynatrace version 1.203+
* For AWS Elemental MediaPackage Video on Demand, Dynatrace version 1.204+
* An updated [AWS monitoring policy](/docs/ingest-from/amazon-web-services/integrate-with-aws/cloudwatch-metrics#monitoring-policy "Integrate metrics from Amazon CloudWatch.") to include the additional AWS services.  
  To [update the AWS IAM policyï»¿](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-edit.html#edit-managed-policy-console), use the JSON below.

## Enable monitoring

To learn how to enable service monitoring, see [Enable service monitoring](/docs/ingest-from/amazon-web-services/integrate-with-aws/aws-metrics-ingest/aws-enable-service-monitoring "Enable AWS monitoring in Dynatrace.").

## View service metrics

You can view the service metrics in your Dynatrace environment either on the **custom device overview page** or on your **Dashboards** page.

### View metrics on the custom device overview page

To access the custom device overview page

1. Go to ![Technologies](https://dt-cdn.net/images/technologies-512-977161d83c.png "Technologies") **Technologies & Processes Classic**.
2. Filter by service name and select the relevant custom device group.
3. Once you select the custom device group, you're on the **custom device group overview page**.
4. The **custom device group overview page** lists all instances (custom devices) belonging to the group. Select an instance to view the **custom device overview page**.

### View metrics on your dashboard

After you add the service to monitoring, a preset dashboard containing all recommended metrics is automatically listed on your **Dashboards** page. To look for specific dashboards, filter by **Preset** and then by **Name**.

![AWS presets](https://dt-cdn.net/images/image-26-1645-389f58aa89.png)

For existing monitored services, you might need to resave your credentials for the preset dashboard to appear on the **Dashboards** page. To resave your credentials, go to **Settings** > **Cloud and virtualization** > **AWS**, select the desired AWS instance, and then select **Save**.

You can't make changes on a preset dashboard directly, but you can clone and edit it. To clone a dashboard, open the browse menu (**â¦**) and select **Clone**.

To remove a dashboard from the dashboards page, you can hide it. To hide a dashboard, open the browse menu (**â¦**) and select **Hide**.

Hiding a dashboard doesn't affect other users.
