An ActiveGate can be used for three different use cases, which we refer to as **purposes**:

* [Route OneAgent traffic to Dynatrace, monitor cloud environments, or monitor remote technologies using extensions](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/capabilities/routing-monitoring-purpose "Learn about the routing and monitoring capabilities and uses of ActiveGate.")
* [Run Synthetic monitors from a private location](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/capabilities/synthetic-purpose "ActiveGates purposed for synthetic monitoring of internal and external resources from private Synthetic locations")
* [Install the zRemote module for z/OS monitoring](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/capabilities/zremote-purpose "Learn about installing the zRemote module for z/OS monitoring.")

Each purpose comes with a different subset of functional [modules](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/configuration/configure-activegate#modules "Learn which ActiveGate properties you can configure based on your needs and requirements."). Modules should not be mixed between purposesâsuch re-configuration is not supported.
