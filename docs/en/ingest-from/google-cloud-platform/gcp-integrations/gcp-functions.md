Google Cloud Functions lets you run your code without provisioning or managing servers. This deployment model is sometimes referred to as "serverless" or "Function as a Service" (FaaS).

* A Google Cloud Function runs in an application on a container managed by Google. This lets you focus on writing code without worrying about the underlying application or infrastructure.
* Google Cloud Functions are ephemeral. This means that the underlying container can be suspended or recycled when there's no request pending.

## Integration

* [Integrate on Google Cloud Functions Node.js](/docs/ingest-from/google-cloud-platform/gcp-integrations/gcp-functions/opentelemetry-on-gcf-nodejs "Monitor Google Cloud Functions with OpenTelemetry for Node.js and Dynatrace.")
* [Integrate on Google Cloud Functions Python](/docs/ingest-from/google-cloud-platform/gcp-integrations/gcp-functions/opentelemetry-on-gcf-python "Monitor Google Cloud Functions with OpenTelemetry for Python and Dynatrace.")
* [Integrate on Google Cloud Functions GoLang](/docs/ingest-from/google-cloud-platform/gcp-integrations/gcp-functions/opentelemetry-on-gcf-go "Monitor Google Cloud Functions with OpenTelemetry for Go and Dynatrace.")
* [Integrate on Google Cloud Functions .NET](/docs/ingest-from/google-cloud-platform/gcp-integrations/gcp-functions/opentelemetry-on-gcf-dotnet "Monitor Google Cloud Functions with OpenTelemetry for .NET and Dynatrace.")
* [Google Cloud Functions monitoring](/docs/ingest-from/google-cloud-platform/gcp-integrations/gcp-functions/cloud-functions-monitoring "Monitor Google Cloud Functions and view available metrics.")

## Monitoring consumption

For Google Cloud Functions, monitoring consumption is based on Davis data units. See [Serverless monitoring](/docs/license/monitoring-consumption-classic/davis-data-units/serverless-monitoring "Understand how serverless monitoring consumption is calculated.") for details.
