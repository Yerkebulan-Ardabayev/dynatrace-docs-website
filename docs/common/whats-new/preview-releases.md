# Preview program

* Latest Dynatrace
* Updated on Feb 04, 2026

We value your insights! By participating in product previews, you become a key part of our development process, ensuring that our solutions continue to meet your needs. Below, you'll find a list of new enhancements that you can access before they are publicly availableâjoin today and be part of our journey!

## Preview Terms

Your use of previewed (i.e. not publicly available) Dynatrace technology (each a "Preview") is governed by the [Dynatrace Subscription Agreementï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/company/trust-center/customers/subscription-agreement/) or, if you and Dynatrace entered into an executed subscription agreement, the executed subscription agreement (in each case, the "Subscription Agreement"), as supplemented by the following:

* A Preview may not reach GA status, and Dynatrace may modify or terminate Preview access at any time. If a Preview will consume licensing units, you'll be informed before accessing the Preview. Previews that can be used free of charge during the Preview period may consume licensing units if/when they reach GA status.
* Previews must be treated as Dynatrace's confidential information under the relevant provisions of the Subscription Agreement. Previews are provided by Dynatrace "AS IS" without any service levels, support commitments, representations or warranties, or indemnity obligations, regardless of whether specified in your Subscription Agreement. Dynatrace shall have no liability of any kind with respect to Preview use unless otherwise required by applicable law, in which case Dynatrace's liability shall not exceed $1,000.00. Dynatrace shall use commercially reasonable efforts to address reports that a Preview does not conform with applicable Documentation but shall not be obligated to correct or replace such non-conformities.
* If you choose to provide feedback, Dynatrace may use the feedback without restriction but shall not publicly identify you without your consent.
* Any inconsistencies between the terms of your Subscription Agreement and these terms shall be resolved in favor of these terms.
* If you do not accept the Preview Terms, you may not access any Preview.

* Agentic and Generative AI Previews: Dynatrace may send your prompts to the LLM providers in the regions published in [Dynatrace Intelligence generative AI data privacy and security](/docs/dynatrace-intelligence/copilot/copilot-data-privacy#prompt-data "Learn about Dynatrace Intelligence generative AI data privacy and security policy."). The prompts are not retained by the LLM providers, however, Dynatrace may store them in the United States in order to provide and monitor the Preview experience and quality. Your acceptance of the Preview Terms for Agentic and Generative AI Previews will apply to all future Agentic and Generative AI Previews that Dynatrace offers under the same terms (i.e. if you wish to participate in any future Agentic and Generative AI Previews that may be offered under these terms, you will not be required to again accept the terms).

## Join a preview

Currently, you can request access for the following enhancements:

### Database Extensions on Kubernetes

Dynatrace version 1.330+

Do you want to run your database monitoring inside a Kubernetes cluster? Are you running databases on Kubernetes and wish your SQL-based extensions could run natively too? Want an easier, UI/API-driven way to deploy and scale them? Join our preview and help shape the future of database extensions on Kubernetes.

We are enabling support in the Extension Framework 2.0 to run Database Extensions natively on K8s. Customers can use the UI, API (Terraform) for deployment. Dynatrace Operator 1.8 is required.

[Request access here](https://forms.office.com/r/9Lx8MUSixv)

### Extended Retention for RUM & Synthetic

Dynatrace version 1.330+

Available to DPS SaaS customers, extended retention lets you keep RUM and Synthetic data beyond the standard 35 days, up to 13 months.

This enables new use cases such as long-term performance trending, seasonal analysis, and fraud detection, and helps meet audit-related data compliance requirements.

Retained data can be queried in the core [Digital Experience apps](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience "Discover the New RUM Experience for unmatched visibility into user behavior and frontend performance."), or via [Dashboards and Notebooks](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/dashboards-and-notebooks "Dashboards and Notebooks").

For more information, see [Calculate your consumption of Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM) - Retain](/docs/license/capabilities/digital-experience-monitoring-query-retain/retention-dem "Learn how your DEM-extended retention is consumed and billed before and after Preview.").

### User Interactions

Dynatrace version 1.330+

User Interactions introduces a new class of frontend RUM events such as clicks, taps, scrolls, drags, zooms, and other UI gestures, that were not captured in Classic RUM. These enable Dynatrace to collect unprecedented rich behavioural analytics while the feature is still being refined. Customers gain early visibility into use cases such as behavioral funnels, feature adoption, retention analysis, and deeper UX insights.

For more information, see [User Interactions documentation](/docs/semantic-dictionary/model/rum/user-events/user-interactions).

### DEM Query

Dynatrace version 1.330+

With the DEM Query Early Access program, customers can execute DEM-related DQL queries across Dashboards, Notebooks, Workflows, Custom Apps, SLOs, and the API that use DEM data without incurring query-based charges during the early access phase. Customers can explore and validate how RUM data on Grail behaves when queried at scale and consolidate their upcoming query-consumption patterns. An out-of-the-box dashboard will automatically be deployed to help customers track query usage.

For more information, see [Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM) Query](/docs/license/capabilities/digital-experience-monitoring-query-retain/queries-dem "Learn how your consumption of the DEM-related DQL queries is consumed and billed before and after Early Access.").
