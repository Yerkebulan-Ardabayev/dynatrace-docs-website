Dynatrace uses a sophisticated AI causation engine called DavisÂ® to automatically detect performance anomalies in your applications, services, and infrastructure. Dynatrace uses detected problems to report and alert on abnormal situations, such as performance degradations, improper functionality, or lack of availability (that is, problems represent anomalies in baseline system performance).

## Use cases

* Detect abnormal behavior in real time based on static or auto-adaptive thresholds, or more complex AI models approach, such as seasonal baselines.
* Quickly react and fix anomalies with automated root cause analysis.
* Save time on manually reproducing errors by retracing the problem development from its appearance to the current status.
