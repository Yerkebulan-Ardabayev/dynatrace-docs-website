Dynatrace Managed is an on-premises observability platform that enables you to analyze, automate, and innovate with the power of AI. Get started with Dynatrace Managed in just a few steps.

## Get started!

### Step 1 Obtain a Dynatrace Managed license

To obtain a license for Dynatrace Managed, contact [Dynatrace Salesï»¿](https://dt-url.net/c901yj9). Your sales representative will provide you with further details. Dynatrace monitoring is licensed based on the consumption of various types of monitoring units, which you purchase and consume based on your monitoring needs. For details, see [License Dynatrace](/managed/license "About Dynatrace Platform Subscription (DPS), the licensing model for all Dynatrace capabilities.").

Once an agreement is reached, you will receive an email that includes your license details and instructions on how to get started.

### Step 2 Set up a Managed cluster

Select a [deployment model](/managed/managed-cluster/basic-concepts/managed-deployments "Find out about your options for deploying Dynatrace Managed.") that best suits your needs. Based on your selected deployment model, [set up a Managed cluster](/managed/managed-cluster/installation/set-up-a-cluster "Learn how to download and install Dynatrace Managed in order to set up your Dynatrace Managed cluster.") and create your first cluster node.

You can [add more nodes](/managed/managed-cluster/installation/add-a-new-cluster-node "Understand the steps required to add a new Dynatrace Managed cluster node.") at any time. A minimum of 3 nodes is required for a Managed cluster in production.

### Step 3 Install ActiveGate

Install [Cluster ActiveGates](/managed/managed-cluster/installation/how-to-install-a-cluster-activegate "Download and install a Cluster ActiveGate in a Dynatrace Managed deployment.") and/or [Environment ActiveGates](/managed/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/installation "Learn how to configure ActiveGate") as required in your selected deployment model.

### Step 4 Ingest observability data

* [Install OneAgent](/managed/ingest-from/dynatrace-oneagent/installation-and-operation "Install OneAgent on a server for the very first time.") on a host to automatically monitor and analyze the performance and health of your entire IT infrastructure,
* or [Ingest data from OpenTelemetryï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/news/blog/send-opentelemetry-data-to-dynatrace/#configure-the-otel-collector-for-dynatrace) for a more hybrid infrastructure.

### Step 5 Verify you receive data

* View your **identified topology with** [Smartscape](/managed/analyze-explore-automate/smartscape-classic "Learn how Smartscape visualizes all the entities and dependencies in your environment.") in your [monitoring environment](/managed/discover-dynatrace/get-started/monitoring-environment "Understand and learn how to work with monitoring environments.").

### Step 6 Visualize data

* Start building your own [Dashboards](/managed/analyze-explore-automate/dashboards-classic "Learn how to create, manage, and use Dynatrace Dashboards Classic.").

### Step 7 Set up notifications

* Set up your first [notifications](/managed/analyze-explore-automate/notifications-and-alerting/problem-notifications "Learn how to integrate third-party problem notification systems with Dynatrace.").
