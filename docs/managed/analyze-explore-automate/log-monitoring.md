With Log Monitoring as a part of the Dynatrace platform, you gain direct access to the log content of all your mission-critical applications, infrastructure and cloud platforms. You can create custom log metrics for smarter and faster troubleshooting. You will be able to understand log data in the context of your full stack, including real user impacts.
