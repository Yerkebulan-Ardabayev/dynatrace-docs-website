You can receive notifications through [various integrations](/managed/analyze-explore-automate/notifications-and-alerting/problem-notifications "Learn how to integrate third-party problem notification systems with Dynatrace.") and gain quick insights into all problems detected by Dynatrace. You can also [set up fine-grained alert-filtering rules](/managed/analyze-explore-automate/notifications-and-alerting/alerting-profiles "Learn how to create and manage alerting profiles.") that are based on the severity, customer impact, associated tags, and/or duration of detected problems. Lastly, you can define [maintenance windows](/managed/analyze-explore-automate/notifications-and-alerting/maintenance-windows "Understand when to use a maintenance window. Read about the supported maintenance window types.") during which alerts won't be generated.

Short-lived problems do not generate open problem notifications. For such problems, Dynatrace sends out only resolved problem notifications to inform you that such a problem occurred.
