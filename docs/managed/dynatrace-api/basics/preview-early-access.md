# Preview and Early Adopter releases for Dynatrace API

* Reference
* Published Feb 07, 2020

Some API requests are available as Early Adopter features or as part of a Preview. These requests are identified with "Early Adopter" and "Preview" notes on corresponding pages in Dynatrace Documentation and in the API explorer (see examples below).

## Early Adopter

Early Adopter release requests are available on an opt-in basis. They aren't feature-complete, but they are publicly available, fully supported, and production-ready.

Non-compatible changes are unlikely to be introduced in Early Adopter API requests, but we can't guarantee full backward compatibility of the GA version with the Early Adopter release.

Early Adopter requests have this mark in the API Explorer:

## Preview

A Preview provides you with access to new features so that we can hear your feedback and ultimately deliver features that exactly meet your needs. Preview requests aren't meant to be used in production environments.

Preview requests aren't publicly availableâyou need to sign up for the respective Preview. See [Preview and Early Adopter releases](/managed/whats-new/preview-releases "Learn about our Preview releases and how you can participate in them.") to learn more about conditions and how to sign up.

Preview requests have this mark in the API Explorer:
