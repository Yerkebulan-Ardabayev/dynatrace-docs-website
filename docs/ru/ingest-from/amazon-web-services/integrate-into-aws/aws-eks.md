Dynatrace OneAgent provides extensive monitoring of Elastic Kubernetes Service pods, nodes, and clusters. The OneAgent deployment process is consistent with other distributions. For more information, see [What is Amazon EKS?ï»¿](https://dt-url.net/zn0388b).

For Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, monitoring consumption is based on host units. See [Application and Infrastructure Monitoring (Host Units)](/docs/license/monitoring-consumption-classic/application-and-infrastructure-monitoring "Understand how Dynatrace application and infrastructure monitoring consumption is calculated based on host units.") for details.
