Learn how OpenTelemetry data ingest is calculated with the Dynatrace Platform Subscription (DPS) license model.

## Overview

Dynatrace provides seamless support for OpenTelemetry data ingestion and processing.
This lets you leverage the power of observability across your distributed systems.

Licensing for OpenTelemetry data is fully integrated into the Dynatrace Platform Subscription model, ensuring that all telemetry types (traces and spans, metrics, and logs) are billed transparently and consistently.

With Dynatrace, OpenTelemetry data is treated like any other ingested data.
Flexible pricing is based on the volume of data ingested, stored, and queried.
Pricing calculations use the same [rate card itemsï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/pricing/) as for all telemetry data that is ingested into the platform.

## Traces powered by Grail (DPS)

Dynatrace allows you to ingest and analyze OpenTelemetry trace data seamlessly.

For complete information, see [Traces powered by Grail overview (DPS)](/docs/license/capabilities/traces "Learn how Dynatrace Traces powered by Grail consumption is calculated using the Dynatrace Platform Subscription (DPS) model.").

### Ingestion

OpenTelemetry trace data is billed by the ingested volume.
It is charged as [Traces â Ingest & Process](/docs/license/capabilities/traces/dps-traces-ingest "Learn how your consumption of the Traces - Ingest & Process DPS capability is billed and charged.").

Full-Stack Monitoring includes a [defined amount of trace data volume](/docs/license/capabilities/app-infra-observability/full-stack-monitoring#full-stack-traces "Learn how your consumption of the Dynatrace Full-Stack Monitoring DPS capability is billed and charged.") for traces that are sent via the OneAgent Trace API or from a Full-Stack monitored host.
You are only charged for trace data (from these sources) that exceeds the included volume.

### Retention

Retention of OpenTelemetry trace data is billed based on the volume of trace data stored.
It is measured in gibibytes per day (GiB-day) and charged as [Traces â Retain](/docs/license/capabilities/traces/dps-traces-retain "Learn how your consumption of the Traces - Retain DPS capability is billed and charged.").

The default [trace data retention period of 10 days](/docs/manage/data-privacy-and-security/data-privacy/data-retention-periods#purepath "Check retention times for various data types.") is included.
Any trace data retained longer than 10 days is charged on a per-gibibyte basis as [Traces - Retain](/docs/license/capabilities/traces#trace-retain-usage "Learn how Dynatrace Traces powered by Grail consumption is calculated using the Dynatrace Platform Subscription (DPS) model.").

### Query

Querying of OpenTelmetry traces is billed based on gibibytes scanned (GiB-scanned) and charged as [Traces â Query](/docs/license/capabilities/traces/dps-traces-query "Learn how your consumption of the Traces - Query DPS capability is billed and charged.").

The use of [![Distributed Tracing](https://dt-cdn.net/images/distributed-tracing-4ed13d1274.svg "Distributed Tracing") **Distributed Tracing**](/docs/observe/application-observability/distributed-tracing "Trace and analyze in real time highly distributed systems with Grail.") and [![Services](https://dt-cdn.net/hub/logos/services.png "Services") **Services**](/docs/observe/application-observability/services/services-app "Maintain centralized control over service health, performance, and resources with the Services app.") is included with Dynatrace.
No query consumption is generated by these apps.

## Metrics powered by Grail (DPS)

Dynatrace supports OpenTelemetry metrics, allowing you to seamlessly ingest and analyze OpenTelemetry data alongside metrics from Dynatrace-monitored environments.
OpenTelemetry metrics are billed as Metrics powered by Grail, just like other ingested metrics.

For complete information, see [Metrics powered by Grail overview (DPS)](/docs/license/capabilities/metrics "Learn how Dynatrace Metrics powered by Grail consumption is calculated using the Dynatrace Platform Subscription model.").

### Ingestion

OpenTelemetry metrics are billed by the number of metric data points ingested, measured as groups of 100,000 data points.
This ingest is charged as [Metrics â Ingest & Process](/docs/license/capabilities/metrics/dps-metrics-ingest "Learn how your consumption of the Metrics - Ingest & Process DPS capability is billed and charged.").

Metrics originating from Full-Stack-monitored hosts or containers [include a defined amount of metric data points](/docs/license/capabilities/app-infra-observability/full-stack-monitoring#dps-included-metrics "Learn how your consumption of the Dynatrace Full-Stack Monitoring DPS capability is billed and charged.").
Each contributing GiB of host or application memory adds 900 data points in each 15-minute interval.

In an environment with Full-Stack Monitoring, you are only charged for metric data points that exceed this limit.

### Retention

Retention of OpenTelemetry metrics is billed based on the volume of metric data stored.
It is measured in gibibytes per day (GiB-day) and charged as [Metrics â Retain](/docs/license/capabilities/metrics/dps-metrics-retain "Learn how your consumption of the Metrics - Retain DPS capability is billed and charged.").

Metrics powered by Grail includes [15 months (462 days) of one-minute granularity](/docs/manage/data-privacy-and-security/data-privacy/data-retention-periods "Check retention times for various data types.").
Metrics that you choose to retain beyond that period are charged.

### Query

Querying metric data is included in [Metrics â Ingest & Process](/docs/license/capabilities/metrics/dps-metrics-ingest "Learn how your consumption of the Metrics - Ingest & Process DPS capability is billed and charged.").

## Logs powered by Grail (DPS)

Dynatrace provides full support for OpenTelemetry logs.
This enables you to centralize log data from OpenTelemetry sources alongside logs from Dynatrace-monitored environments. OpenTelemetry logs are billed as Logs powered by Grail.

For complete information, see [Log Analytics (DPS)](/docs/license/capabilities/log-analytics "Learn how Dynatrace Log Analytics consumption is calculated using the Dynatrace Platform Subscription model.").

### Ingestion

OpenTelemetry log data is billed by the volume ingested.
It is measured in gibibytes (GiB) and charged as [Log Management & Analytics â Ingest & Process](/docs/license/capabilities/log-analytics/dps-log-ingest "Learn how your consumption of the Log Management & Analytics - Ingest & Process DPS capability is billed and charged.").

### Retention

Retention of log data is billed based on the volume of log data stored.
It is measured in gibibytes per day (GiB-day) and charged as [Log Management & Analytics â Retain](/docs/license/capabilities/log-analytics/dps-log-retain "Learn how your consumption of the Log Management & Analytics - Retain DPS capability is billed and charged.").

### Query

Querying log data is billed based on the volume of log data queried.
It is measured in gibibytes scanned (GiB-scanned) and charged as [Log Management & Analytics - Query](/docs/license/capabilities/log-analytics/dps-log-query "Learn how your consumption of the Log Management & Analytics - Query DPS capability is billed and charged.").

## Track your consumption

Dynatrace provides different ways to track your OpenTelmetry ingest.
These are described on the respective DPS capability page:

* [Pre-made notebooks to track your trace ingest](/docs/license/capabilities/traces/dps-traces-ingest#consumption-trace-ingest "Learn how your consumption of the Traces - Ingest & Process DPS capability is billed and charged.")
* [Built-in metrics to track your log ingest](/docs/license/capabilities/log-analytics/dps-log-ingest#track-your-consumption "Learn how your consumption of the Log Management & Analytics - Ingest & Process DPS capability is billed and charged.")
* [Calculations to track your metrics ingest](/docs/license/capabilities/metrics/dps-metrics-ingest#calculate-your-consumption "Learn how your consumption of the Metrics - Ingest & Process DPS capability is billed and charged.")
