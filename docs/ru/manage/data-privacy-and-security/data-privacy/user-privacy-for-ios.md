Starting December 8, 2020, Apple requires you to provide information about your app's privacy practices, including the practices of third-party partners like Dynatrace.

On this page, you'll find information about what kind of data [Dynatrace OneAgent for iOS](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app "Instrument mobile application monitoring for iOS apps, customize the auto-instrumentation, and capture additional data via manual instrumentation.") captures by default. The data categories and types reflect the Apple questionnaire, but note that the answers reflect the out-of-the-box, default state. For a detailed description of individual data types, see [App privacy details on the App Storeï»¿](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/) on the Apple developer portal.

OneAgent may capture additional data through your [manual instrumentation](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/oneagent-sdk-for-ios "Enrich mobile user experience monitoring using OneAgent SDK for iOS."). If you instrument your app to capture additional data, make sure you reflect it in your app privacy questionnaire.
