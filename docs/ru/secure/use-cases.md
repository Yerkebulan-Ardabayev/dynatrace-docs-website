# Use cases

# Use cases

* Latest Dynatrace
* Overview
* Updated on Jan 29, 2026

With the power of [Grail](/docs/platform/grail "Insights on what and how you can query Dynatrace data.") and the [security data](/docs/secure/threat-observability/concepts#security-data "Basic concepts related to Threat Observability") ingested into it, various data analysis, reporting, and automation use cases can be implemented.

## Incident response

* [Analyze Amazon API Gateway access logs with Investigations](/docs/secure/use-cases/analyze-aws-api-gateway-access-logs-with-security-investigator "Monitor and identify errors in your Amazon API Gateway access logs with Dynatrace.")
* [Analyze AWS CloudTrail logs with Investigations](/docs/secure/use-cases/analyze-aws-cloudtrail-logs-with-security-investigator "Analyze CloudTrail logs and find potential security issues with Dynatrace.")
* [Detect threats against your AWS Secrets with Investigations](/docs/secure/use-cases/detect-threats-against-aws-secrets-with-security-investigator "Monitor and identify potential threats against your AWS Secrets with Dynatrace.")
* [Operationalize DQL query results with Investigations](/docs/secure/use-cases/operationalize-query-results "Build DQL queries from your query results faster and more conveniently with Dynatrace Investigations.")
* [Resolve incidents faster with Investigations templates](/docs/secure/use-cases/resolve-incidents-faster-with-templates "Speed up your log-related investigations with Investigations templates.")
* [Speed up incident response with Dynatrace Investigations reference time](/docs/secure/use-cases/speed-up-incident-response-with-reference-time "Enhance your log-related investigations with Dynatrace Investigations reference time.")
* [Threat hunting and forensics](/docs/secure/use-cases/threat-hunting "Use case scenario for threat hunting and forensics with Investigations.")

## Security orchestration

* [Automate and orchestrate security findings](/docs/secure/use-cases/automate-and-orchestrate-security-findings "Regularly check for critical security findings and get automatic Jira tickets or Slack alerts.")
* [Automated threat-alert triaging](/docs/secure/use-cases/automated-threat-alert-triaging "Use case scenario for automating threat-alert triaging with Dynatrace.")
* [Detect threats in cloud-native environments using workflows](/docs/secure/use-cases/detect-threats-cloud-native-workflows "Monitor and identify threats in your cloud-native environments with Dynatrace.")
* [Ingest and process custom security findings](/docs/secure/use-cases/ingest-and-process-custom-security-findings "Continuously ingest your container scan findings.")
* [CSPM Notification Automation](/docs/secure/use-cases/notification-automation "Improve cloud security posture by automatically processing, triaging, enriching, and classifying incoming security alerts.")

## Security posture analysis

* [Discover coverage gaps in security findings](/docs/secure/use-cases/discover-coverage-gaps-in-security-scans "Unveil blind spots in your Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).")
* [Monitor suspicious sign-in activity with Dynatrace](/docs/secure/use-cases/monitor-sign-in-activity "Analyze suspicious and malicious sign-in behaviors with Dynatrace.")
* [Runtime contextualization of container findings](/docs/secure/use-cases/runtime-contextualization-of-container-findings "Triage critical vulnerability findings in production applications on containers with vulnerable container images.")
* [Stay compliant with Security Posture Management](/docs/secure/use-cases/stay-compliant "Stay on top of your security measures, policies, and practices.")
* [Visualize and analyze security findings](/docs/secure/use-cases/visualize-and-analyze-security-findings "Visualize, prioritize, and analyze ingested security findings.")

## AI-driven automation

* [Automate vulnerability remediation with Atlassian Rovo Dev and Dynatrace](/docs/secure/use-cases/ai-remediation-atlassian-rovo-dev "Prioritize and remediate vulnerabilities with Atlassian Rovo Dev and Dynatrace.")
* [Automate vulnerability remediation with GitHub Copilot and Dynatrace](/docs/secure/use-cases/ai-remediation-github-copilot "Automate vulnerability remediation using GitHub Copilot and Dynatrace runtime insights.")
