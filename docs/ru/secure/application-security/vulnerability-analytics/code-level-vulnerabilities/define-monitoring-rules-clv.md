You can create your own fine-grained monitoring rules for code-level vulnerabilities based on [resource attributes](/docs/ingest-from/extend-dynatrace/extend-data "Learn how to automatically enrich your telemetry data with Dynatrace-specific fields."), and define multiple conditions for one rule. When creating a rule, you can check if conditions apply and how many process groups are affected.
The rules you create override the global code-level vulnerability detection control for the selected technology.

## Prerequisites

[Enable Code-level Vulnerability Analytics](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics#enable-clva "Monitor, visualize, analyze, and remediate third-party and code-level vulnerabilities, track the remediation progress, and create monitoring rules.").

## Create custom monitoring rules

1. Go to **Settings** > **Analyze and alert** > **Application security** > **Rules for code-level vulnerabilities** and select **Add new rule**.

2. Optional Name your rule (if not, a name will be assigned to it automatically once you create the rule, based on your criteria).
3. For **Code-level vulnerability control**, specify how to control a vulnerability that matches the rule criteria:

   * **Do not monitor** â Code-level vulnerabilities for the selected conditions are ignored.
   * **Monitor** â Code-level vulnerabilities for the selected selected conditions are reported.
4. Optional If you want the rule to apply only to a subset of your environment, for **Specify where the rule is applied**, select **Add new condition** and provide the resource attributes that should be used to identify that part of the environment (for example, `dt.entity.process_group`, `aws.region`). For details, see [Enrich ingested data with Dynatrace-specific fields](/docs/ingest-from/extend-dynatrace/extend-data "Learn how to automatically enrich your telemetry data with Dynatrace-specific fields.").
5. Optional To check if a rule applies, select **Preview matching process group instances**. This lists process group instances that currently match the criteria.
6. Select **Save changes**.
7. Restart your processes.

You can edit, disable, enable, or remove rules at any time.

Monitoring rules are ordered; the first matching rule applies.

## Coverage impact

Monitoring rules directly influence host and process coverage. If a host or process group is excluded by a rule, it won't be monitored for vulnerabilities.

Latest Dynatrace To review how your monitoring rules affect overall coverage, see [Assess coverage](/docs/secure/vulnerabilities/assess-coverage "Evaluate your environment's RVA process and host coverage with the Vulnerability coverage dashboard.").

## FAQ

* What happens if I change the order of the rules?

  + The first matching rule applies.
* What happens if a **Do not monitor** rule that applies gets added?

  + New vulnerabilities for the processes that match the rule won't be created.
  + Existing vulnerabilities that only relate to matching processes are resolved.
* What happens if a **Do not monitor** rule is deleted or doesn't apply anymore?

  + New vulnerabilities for the processes that match the rule will be created.
  + Related resolved vulnerabilities are reopened.
