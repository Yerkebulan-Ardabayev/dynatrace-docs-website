# Upgrade Thirdâparty and Codeâlevel vulnerabilities to the 3rd generation experience

# Upgrade Thirdâparty and Codeâlevel vulnerabilities to the 3rd generation experience

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Updated on Feb 23, 2026

If you're currently using the third party or code level vulnerabilities pages, you can upgrade to the [![Vulnerabilities](https://dt-cdn.net/images/vulnerabilities-highresolution-1025-9279da9743.png "Vulnerabilities") **Vulnerabilities** app](/docs/secure/vulnerabilities "Prioritize and efficiently manage vulnerabilities in your monitored environments."), which provides a unified, improved view in the latest Dynatrace experience.

## Why upgrade?

The new ![Vulnerabilities](https://dt-cdn.net/images/vulnerabilities-highresolution-1025-9279da9743.png "Vulnerabilities") **Vulnerabilities** app offers:

* **Advanced filtering**: Use the [new filtering mechanism](/docs/secure/vulnerabilities/manage-results#filter "Filter, format, and sort to find relevant vulnerability information.") to search and prioritize vulnerabilities across your stack.
* **Additional prioritization option**: Leverage [CISA KEV insights](/docs/secure/vulnerabilities/prioritize#cisa-kev "Prioritize third-party, code-level, and runtime vulnerabilities.").
* **Full data access**: Query vulnerability data in [Grail](/docs/platform/grail "Insights on what and how you can query Dynatrace data.") with [Dynatrace Query Language (DQL)](/docs/platform/grail/dynatrace-query-language "How to use Dynatrace Query Language."), build dashboards, and automate workflows.
* **State report queries**: Drill down with DQL and create dashboards (see [example query](/docs/secure/threat-observability/dql-examples#vulnerabilities-per-application "DQL examples for security data powered by Grail.")).
* **Guidance from Dynatrace Intelligence generative AI**: Get [explanations and remediation suggestions](/docs/secure/vulnerabilities/address-remediation#explain "Address remediation and optimize remediation activities.").
* **Unified findings view**: See all vulnerability findings from Dynatrace and integrated scanners in one place.  
  Use the [Findings page](/docs/secure/vulnerabilities/explore-findings "View, filter, and analyze vulnerability findings from Dynatrace and external security tools.") to filter, sort, group, and remove duplicate results, and to access detailed context such as severity, affected objects, component metadata, and source information.
* **Coverage of library vulnerabilities**: Use the [Vulnerability coverage dashboard](/docs/secure/vulnerabilities/assess-coverage "Evaluate your environment's RVA process and host coverage with the Vulnerability coverage dashboard.") to identify monitoring gaps, understand which entities are most affected at runtime, and track exposure trends over time.

## Whatâs changing and what you need to do

Below are the key changes when moving from the classic apps to the latest Dynatrace experience, along with the actions you should take.

### Permissions

| Latest Dynatrace | Previous Dynatrace |
| --- | --- |
| Permissions are aligned with [Dynatrace IAM](/docs/manage/identity-access-management/permission-management/manage-user-permissions-policies "Working with policies"). | Permissions are tied to management zones and app access. |

**Improvement for you**:

* **Compliance support**: IAM permissions align with industry standards like OIDC, OAuth 2.0, SAML, and SCIM, helping organizations meet regulatory and compliance requirements.
* **Efficient user management**: IAM simplifies user and group management, allowing integration with identity providers (IdPs) and centralized control over authentication and authorization.

**Your action**: [Set up IAM permissions](/docs/secure/vulnerabilities#permissions "Prioritize and efficiently manage vulnerabilities in your monitored environments.") before using the ![Vulnerabilities](https://dt-cdn.net/images/vulnerabilities-highresolution-1025-9279da9743.png "Vulnerabilities") **Vulnerabilities** app.

### Management zones

| Latest Dynatrace | Previous Dynatrace |
| --- | --- |
| You can slice and dice data with [segments](/docs/manage/segments "Use segments to logically structure and conveniently filter observability data across apps."). | You can scope vulnerability data with management zones. |

**Improvement for you**: [Data segmentation](/docs/platform/upgrade#data-segmentation "Use the power of Grail, AppEngine, and AutomationEngine to take advantage of improvements in storing and analyzing observability and security data.") acts as logical filtering, recalculating DSS only for selected entities, helping you focus on relevant risks.

* On the **Prioritization** page, segments are applied using fields from state reports.
* On the **Findings** page, segments are applied using fields from vulnerability findings.

**Your action**: Use the [segment selector](/docs/secure/vulnerabilities/manage-results#segments "Filter, format, and sort to find relevant vulnerability information.") to filter vulnerabilities and affected entities.

### Monitoring rules

| Latest Dynatrace | Previous Dynatrace |
| --- | --- |
| You define monitoring rules based on resource attributes and Kubernetes labels. | You define monitoring rules based on management zones or tags. |

**Improvement for you**: You gain more precise data segmentation, support for Kubernetes labels, and alignment with the Dynatrace unified access and resource model. Rules are easier to maintain, transparent, and futureâproof.

**Your action**:

* **Thirdâparty vulnerabilities**:

  + Although classic rules based on management zones and tags still work after upgrading to the latest Dynatrace experience, they are scheduled for deprecation. We strongly recommend migrating to the [new rules based on resource attributes or Kubernetes labels](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/third-party-vulnerabilities/define-monitoring-rules-tpv#new "Create, modify, and delete custom monitoring rules for Dynatrace-monitored processes."). Automatic migration isn't possible; for details, see [FAQ](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/third-party-vulnerabilities/define-monitoring-rules-tpv#migrate "Create, modify, and delete custom monitoring rules for Dynatrace-monitored processes.").
  + New rules based on resource attributes are already compatible, no migration needed.
* **Codeâlevel vulnerabilities**: Rules are already based on resource attributes; no changes are required.

### Security notifications

| Latest Dynatrace | Previous Dynatrace |
| --- | --- |
| You create and orchestrate alerts via [Workflows **Workflows**](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/workflows "Automate IT processes with Dynatrace Workflowsâreact to events, schedule tasks, and connect services."). | You configure security notifications globally in Settings (Classic). |

**Improvement for you**: You can define granular conditions, integrate with external tools ([Slack](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/workflows/actions/slack "Send messages to Slack Workspaces"), [Teams](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/workflows/actions/microsoft-teams "Send messages to Microsoft Teams"), [Jira](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/workflows/actions/jira "Automate creating, transitioning, commenting, and assigning Jira issues on the events and schedules defined for your workflows."), [ServiceNow](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/workflows/actions/service-now "Automate creation of incidents in ServiceNow based on your monitoring data and events."), [email](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/workflows/actions/email "Automate sending out-of-the-box emails based on the events and schedules defined for your workflows.")), and orchestrate multiple actions in one workflow. This enables flexible, automated responses tailored to your environment.

**Your action**: Recreate notifications using workflows.

### Muting logic

| Latest Dynatrace | Previous Dynatrace |
| --- | --- |
| A vulnerability is muted only when all affected entities are muted. | You can mute vulnerabilities globally. |

**Improvement for you**: You gain finer control, transparency, and assurance that teams focus only on vulnerabilities that remain relevant.

**Your action**: [Adjust your muting practices to entityâlevel logic](/docs/secure/vulnerabilities/address-remediation#mute-entities "Address remediation and optimize remediation activities.").

## How to upgrade



1. [Set up the IAM permissions](/docs/secure/vulnerabilities#permissions "Prioritize and efficiently manage vulnerabilities in your monitored environments.").
2. Recommended Recreate or migrate existing [classic monitoring rules for third-party vulnerabilities](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/third-party-vulnerabilities/define-monitoring-rules-tpv#classic "Create, modify, and delete custom monitoring rules for Dynatrace-monitored processes.") to [resourceâattributeââbased rules](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/third-party-vulnerabilities/define-monitoring-rules-tpv#new "Create, modify, and delete custom monitoring rules for Dynatrace-monitored processes.").
