# Manage third-party vulnerabilities

# Manage third-party vulnerabilities

* Explanation
* Updated on Sep 10, 2025

This page refers to the classic ![Third Party Vulnerabilities](https://dt-cdn.net/images/third-party-vulnerabilities-512-1b375181bf.png "Third Party Vulnerabilities") **Third-Party Vulnerabilities** app, which is deprecated. If you're currently using this app, we recommend transitioning to the corresponding [![Vulnerabilities](https://dt-cdn.net/images/vulnerabilities-highresolution-1025-9279da9743.png "Vulnerabilities") **Vulnerabilities**](/docs/secure/vulnerabilities "Prioritize and efficiently manage vulnerabilities in your monitored environments.") in the latest Dynatrace experience, which offers enhanced functionality and ongoing support. For details, see [Vulnerabilities upgrade guide](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/vulnerabilities-upgrade-classic-to-latest "Upgrade from the classic Thirdâparty and Codeâlevel vulnerabilities apps to the Vulnerabilities app in the latest Dynatrace.").

A third-party vulnerability is a security problem detected in the third-party libraries loaded in your environment. After you [enable and configure Dynatrace Runtime Vulnerability Analytics](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics "Monitor, visualize, analyze, and remediate third-party and code-level vulnerabilities, track the remediation progress, and create monitoring rules."), Dynatrace starts monitoring your applications to detect vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.

## Third-party vulnerabilities list

To see a list of all detected third-party vulnerabilities in your environment, go to ![Third Party Vulnerabilities](https://dt-cdn.net/images/third-party-vulnerabilities-512-1b375181bf.png "Third Party Vulnerabilities") **Third-Party Vulnerabilities**.
The following information is displayed.

### General overview of the key features

![key-feat-tpv](https://dt-cdn.net/images/2023-03-14-09-14-17-1579-32c8119346.png)

The numeric values displayed are management-zone aware.

### Vulnerabilities detected



![Third-party vulnerability list](https://dt-cdn.net/images/2024-02-14-09-27-51-1575-70c71f9742.png)

A list of all detected third-party vulnerabilities in your environment.
For optimized performance, a maximum of 500 vulnerabilities are displayed at a time. You can narrow down the results by applying [filters](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/third-party-vulnerabilities/filter-third-party-vulnerabilities#filter "Organize third-party vulnerabilities for easy management and to prioritize issues.").
To sort the list by any item, select the corresponding column heading. To add or remove column headings, select **Format table**.

#### Vulnerability

* The vulnerability ID provided by Dynatrace (example: `S-3440`)
* Depending on the vulnerability feed:

  + For [Snykï»¿](https://snyk.io) vulnerabilities, the Snyk name (example: `Denial of Service (DoS)`)
  + For [NVDï»¿](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln) vulnerabilities, the [CVEï»¿](https://cve.mitre.org/) ID (example: `CVE-2020-2805`), or the [CWEï»¿](https://cwe.mitre.org/) name, if available (example: `Deserialization of Untrusted Data`)

    - One vulnerability in Dynatrace can have multiple CVEs (for example, if different vendors release their own CVEs).
    - There can be different vulnerabilities for one component (library).
    - One security problem can generate multiple Dynatrace vulnerabilities, one for each affected technology.
* The vulnerable component (the software component (library) or runtime component (for example, a Kubernetes package) that has a vulnerable function causing a vulnerability):

  + For Snyk-based vulnerabilities, the package name (example: `org.apache.tomcat:tomcat-coyote`)
  + For NVD-based vulnerabilities, the runtime technology (examples: `Java runtime`, `Node.js runtime`)

To find out how Dynatrace evaluates components, see [How vulnerabilities are evaluated: Third-party vulnerabilities](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/vulnerability-evaluation#tpv "Explore the mechanism for generating third-party and code-level vulnerabilities in Dynatrace.").

#### Davis Security Score

* The Davis Security Score risk level (`Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`, `None`) of the vulnerability, based on the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scoreï»¿](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerability_Scoring_System) of the vulnerability and AI-enhanced to take public internet exposure and reachable data assets into consideration. If a vulnerability has been resolved, the symbol color is green.
* The overall risk assessment (the [final score](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/third-party-vulnerabilities/davis-security-score#score "Calculate the Davis Security Score and predict potential vulnerability risks with Davis AI.")).
* If there is any **public internet exposure** (the vulnerability affects at least one process that is exposed to the internet). To find out how Dynatrace determines public internet exposure, see [FAQ: How is public internet exposure determined?](/docs/secure/faq#internet-exposure "Frequently asked questions about Dynatrace Application Security.").
  If the symbol is grayed out and crossed out, no public internet exposure was found. If the symbol isn't present, no data is available.
* If there are any **reachable data assets** (the vulnerability affects a process that has database access, based on the [Dynatrace entity model (Smartscape)](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/smartscape-classic "Learn how Smartscape Classic visualizes all the entities and dependencies in your environment.")). If the symbol is grayed out and crossed out, there are no reachable data assets within range. If the symbol isn't present, no data is available.
* If there is any **vulnerable function** in use by a process, which allows the vulnerability to be exploited. If the symbol is grayed out and crossed out, there's no vulnerable function in use. If the symbol isn't present, no data is available.
* If there is any **public exploit** (a known malicious code that exploits this vulnerability). If the symbol is grayed out and crossed out, there's no public exploit. If the symbol isn't present, no data is available.

#### CVSS score

The base CVSS score of the vulnerability. This column is hidden by default and can be enabled via **Format table**.

#### Status

* **Open:** The vulnerability is active.
* **Resolved:** The vulnerability has been closed automatically because the root cause (for example, loading a vulnerable library) is no longer present. For more information, see [Vulnerability evaluation: Resolution](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/vulnerability-evaluation#tpv-resolution "Explore the mechanism for generating third-party and code-level vulnerabilities in Dynatrace.").
* **Muted - Open:** The vulnerability is active but has been silenced by request.
* **Muted - Resolved:** The silenced active vulnerability has been closed automatically because the root cause (for example, loading a vulnerable library) is no longer present.

  A muted vulnerability that has been closed automatically doesn't change its status to `Resolved`, but to `Muted - Resolved`.

#### Affected entities

The entities (process groups, Kubernetes nodes) that are affected by the identified third-party vulnerability.

#### Technology

The technology of the process affected by the vulnerability.

To display this column, select **Format table** and add **Technology** to the list.

#### First detected

When Dynatrace first detected the third-party vulnerability.

#### Last update

Timestamp of the last status change of the third-party vulnerability. A status change can be when:

* The vulnerability is resolved or reopened
* The vulnerability is muted or unmuted
* The number of affected process groups has decreased or increased
* The risk assessment has changed
* The Davis Security Score has changed
* A new software component is detected

For details, see [FAQ: What does "last update" refer to?](/docs/secure/faq#last-update "Frequently asked questions about Dynatrace Application Security.").

To display this column, select **Format table** and add **Last update** to the list.

If you want to [change the status of a vulnerability](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/third-party-vulnerabilities/filter-third-party-vulnerabilities#mute "Organize third-party vulnerabilities for easy management and to prioritize issues."), select **Change status** in the upper-right corner of the page.

### Vulnerability details

![vuln-details-snyk-feed](https://dt-cdn.net/images/2022-11-11-8-59-22-910-e337d9f503.png)

* The name and description of the affected package (example: `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind`), the associated technology (example: `Java`), and links to the Snyk/CVE/CWE/OWASP IDs for further information.

#### Fix recommendation

For vulnerabilities based on the [Snykï»¿](https://snyk.io/) feed, a fix recommendation is displayed if one is available. It consists of a library upgrade suggestion to solve the vulnerability.

![fix recommendation from snyk](https://dt-cdn.net/images/2024-05-17-07-34-40-800-7bdff77acd.png)

Make sure to restart processes after upgrading a library.

#### Vulnerable functions

The exact classes (example: `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.jsontype.impl.SubTypeValidator`) and functions (example: `validateSubType`) causing the vulnerability, and the affected process groups based on the function usage.

This section is not displayed

* If no vulnerable function information is provided by Snyk or the Dynatrace security research team.
* For runtime vulnerabilities, which are based on the NVD feed.

**Function usage** shows whether the vulnerable function is being used by your application. Based on whether your application uses the vulnerable function, you can assess the impact on your environment. The usage of a vulnerable function is calculated on the process level and is aggregated to the process group level, which results in a count of affected process groups per function.

* **In use:** A count of the related process groups that are affected by the vulnerability (use at least one vulnerable function). Select the number of affected process groups to navigate to [remediation tracking](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/third-party-vulnerabilities/remediation-tracking "Track the remediation progress of vulnerabilities.").
* **Not in use:** A count of related process groups that don't use any vulnerable function.
* **Not available:** A count of related process groups for which the vulnerable function usage could not be determined. For a list of potential reasons, see [FAQ](#faq).

  The information is based on management zones, not on the timeframe.

#### How it works

* If Snyk or the Dynatrace security research team provides information about the vulnerable function, and OneAgent monitoring for Java vulnerable functions is enabled, OneAgent determines whether the vulnerable function is in use.

  Example:

  ![usage-oa-enabled](https://dt-cdn.net/images/usage-oa-enabled-916-5b2cbd3f7d.png)
* If Snyk or the Dynatrace security research team provides information about the vulnerable function, but the OneAgent feature is disabled, the number of vulnerable functions is displayed as **Not available**.

  Example:

  ![usage-oa-disabled](https://dt-cdn.net/images/usage-oa-disabled-1008-0ff9e7d45b.png)

For instructions on how to enable OneAgent monitoring, see [Enable OneAgent monitoring for Java vulnerable functions](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics#vulnerable-function "Monitor, visualize, analyze, and remediate third-party and code-level vulnerabilities, track the remediation progress, and create monitoring rules.").

Restart required

If information about vulnerable functions is outdated, you are prompted to restart processes so that OneAgent can pick up and use the new data. The following message is displayed: `Restart required: Restart the process(es) for updated vulnerable function data.`

Example:

![Restart required on vulnerability details page](https://dt-cdn.net/images/2023-12-18-09-34-40-778-11c7311d23.png)

For more information, such as how determine which processes you need to restart, see [FAQ: How can I know if information about vulnerable functions is outdated and what can I do about it?](/docs/secure/faq#outdated-vulnerable-functions "Frequently asked questions about Dynatrace Application Security.").

### Davis Security Score

![Davis Security Score](https://dt-cdn.net/images/2024-02-14-13-41-24-780-f51f2513e9.png)

A detailed view of [how the Davis Security Score for the opened vulnerability is calculated](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/third-party-vulnerabilities/davis-security-score "Calculate the Davis Security Score and predict potential vulnerability risks with Davis AI."): starting from the CVSS from Snyk, Davis checks whether there is public internet exposure or reachable data affected and, if so, to what extent. The score is then adjusted as applicable based on the [Davis AI calculations](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/third-party-vulnerabilities/davis-security-advisor "Get recommendations for security fixes from Davis Security Advisor.").

### Reachable data assets

![reachable-assets-tpv-details](https://dt-cdn.net/images/2022-11-11-10-52-09-767-41a1d8055c.png)

The last five database services accessed by affected processes containing the identified vulnerability, based on the last hour. Select **View all** to navigate to **Databases**. For information on how to monitor your database performance, see [Databases](/docs/observe/infrastructure-observability/databases "Track the database performance and resources to create and maintain a high performing and available application infrastructure.").

### Vulnerability evolution



**Use case**: Have a better understanding of the evolution of a vulnerability over time.

The **Vulnerability evolution** section displays the following information.

#### Status

The current status of the vulnerability.

* For open vulnerabilities:

  + The current risk level and score (for example, `Critical risk vulnerability: 10.0`) and the time when the vulnerability was open (for example, `Opened 121 d 22 h ago (December 12 14:38)`).
  + The Davis Security Score compared to the base score (CVSS).
  + The current risk assessment (for example, `Public internet exposure detected`).
  + The number of affected processes (for example, `1 affected process (in 168 process groups)`) or, in the case of Kubernetes vulnerabilities, of affected nodes (for example, `1 affected node`).

  Example:

  ![Example status](https://dt-cdn.net/images/2024-02-14-13-46-42-781-2859677977.png)
* For resolved vulnerabilities, the current status and the time when the vulnerability was resolved.

### Process group overview

![pg-overview-tpv-details](https://dt-cdn.net/images/2022-11-11-11-58-16-770-1240069b87.png)

Displays the following information, based on the last hour:

#### Process groups

* **Process groups in total:** The total number of process groups that are related (affected, resolved, and muted) to the identified vulnerability. It links to the overview page of the related process groups.
* **Affected process groups:** The number of affected process groups and the percentage of affected process groups out of the total number of related process groups. It links to the overview page of related process groups filtered by `Status: Affected`.

  + An affected process group is a process group that contains a vulnerable library or runtime.
  + The number of affected process groups matches the total count only if all functions in all used software component versions are vulnerable.

  Example

  A software component `A` is vulnerable to a vulnerability `X` in versions `1` and `2`.

  The function `f1` is only vulnerable in version `1`.

  There are two process groups:

  + Process group `PG1` uses the software component `A.1`, which includes the vulnerable function `f1`.
  + Process group `PG2` uses the software component `A.2`, which doesn't include any vulnerable function.

  The **Process groups overview** section on the details page of a vulnerability will show the vulnerable function `f1` with one process group (`PG1`) `In use` and `Not in use`. `PG2` is not considered because there is no vulnerable function in version `2`.
* **Resolved process groups:** The number of affected process groups that have been resolved and the percentage of resolved process groups out of the total number of related process groups. It links to the overview page of related process groups filtered by `Status: Resolved`.
* **Muted process groups:** The number of affected process groups that have been muted and the percentage of muted process groups out of the total number of related process groups. It links to the overview page of related process groups filtered by `Status: Muted`.
* A graph displaying the affected, resolved, and muted process groups, marked with different colors.

#### Processes

* **Processes total:** The total number of processes (affected and unaffected) out of the process groups where at least one process is affected.
* **Affected processes:** The number of affected processes.

  An affected process is a process that contains a vulnerable library or runtime. It can be exposed to the public internet or not.
* **Exposed:** The number of affected processes that are exposed to the public internet and the percentage of exposed processes out of the total number of affected processes.

#### Most affected process groups

Lists and links to the top five process groups, sorted by status (`Affected`, then `Resolved`, and then `Muted`) and amount of affected processes out of the total processes in the respective process group, and indicates if there is any public internet exposure, or if there are any reachable data assets. Select **View all process groups** to navigate to the overview page of the process groups related to a vulnerability.

## FAQ



* Why is there no data available for vulnerable functions?

  + See below for potential reasons why, on the **Third-party vulnerability** details page, in the [infographic of the key features](#key-features) and the [Vulnerability details section](#vulnerability-details), the **Not available** status is displayed for vulnerable functions.

    - Once you [enable Third-party Vulnerability Analytics](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics#enable-tpva "Monitor, visualize, analyze, and remediate third-party and code-level vulnerabilities, track the remediation progress, and create monitoring rules."), it will take some time (one hour at the most) until data about vulnerable functions is displayed.
    - OneAgent monitoring for Java vulnerable functions is disabled. To enable it, see [Enable OneAgent monitoring for Java vulnerable functions](/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics#vulnerable-function "Monitor, visualize, analyze, and remediate third-party and code-level vulnerabilities, track the remediation progress, and create monitoring rules.").

      The OneAgent feature must be enabled for all processes affected by the vulnerability.
    - No vulnerable functions of the vulnerability are contained in the release version of the third-party libraries (software components) in use.
    - No vulnerable functions are provided by Snyk or the Dynatrace security research team.
    - You need to restart the processes affected by the vulnerability for updated information. For details, see [FAQ: How can I know if information about vulnerable functions is outdated and what can I do about it?](/docs/secure/faq#outdated-vulnerable-functions "Frequently asked questions about Dynatrace Application Security.").
