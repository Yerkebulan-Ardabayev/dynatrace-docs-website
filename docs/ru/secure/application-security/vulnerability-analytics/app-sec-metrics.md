# Metrics Classic for Dynatrace Runtime Vulnerability Analytics

* Reference
* Updated on Nov 06, 2025

This page refers to the classic ![Third Party Vulnerabilities](https://dt-cdn.net/images/third-party-vulnerabilities-512-1b375181bf.png "Third Party Vulnerabilities") **Third-Party Vulnerabilities** and ![Code Level Vulnerabilities](https://dt-cdn.net/images/code-level-vulnerabilities-512-49803cb5cf.png "Code Level Vulnerabilities") **Code-Level Vulnerabilities** apps, which are deprecated. If you're currently using these apps, we recommend transitioning to the unified [![Vulnerabilities](https://dt-cdn.net/images/vulnerabilities-highresolution-1025-9279da9743.png "Vulnerabilities") **Vulnerabilities**](/docs/secure/vulnerabilities "Prioritize and efficiently manage vulnerabilities in your monitored environments.") in the latest Dynatrace experience, which offers enhanced functionality and ongoing support. For details, see [Upgrade to the latest Dynatrace](/docs/platform/upgrade "Use the power of Grail, AppEngine, and AutomationEngine to take advantage of improvements in storing and analyzing observability and security data.").

## Available metrics

The following Application Security metrics are available for Runtime Vulnerability Analytics.

### Vulnerabilities

#### Dimensions used in vulnerability metrics

* Risk level (`Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`, `None`)
* Type (`Third-party vulnerability`, `Code-level vulnerability`)
* Management zone name â only for split-by-zone metrics
* Vulnerable component type (`Library`, `Runtime`) â only available for third-party vulnerabilities
* Public internet exposure (`Public internet exposure`, `No public internet exposure`, `Public internet exposure not available`)
* Reachable data assets (`Reachable data assets`, `No reachable data assets`, `Reachable data assets not available`)
* Vulnerable functions (`Vulnerable functions in use`, `No vulnerable functions in use`, `Vulnerable functions not available`)
* Assessment accuracy (`Full accuracy`, `Reduced accuracy`, `Accuracy not available`)
* Public exploit (`Public exploit published`, `No public exploit published`)

### Affected entities

#### Dimensions used in affected entities metrics

* Security problem ID
* External vulnerability ID
* Title
* Vulnerable component (Package name or `Not available`)
* CVE (All related CVE IDs or `Not available`)
* Risk level (`CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`, `NONE`)
* Technology (`Java`, `.NET`, `Node.js`, `PHP`, `GO`)
* Type (`Third-party vulnerability`, `Code-level vulnerability`)

## View

To view Application Security metrics

1. Go to **Metrics**.
2. Filter for the category of metrics you want, for example `affected process groups`.

   * If you don't see results, turn off **Only show metrics reported after the start of the selected timeframe**.
   * You can add more filters (`Tag`, `Unit`, `Favorites`). See [Filter and sort the table](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/dashboards-classic/metrics-browser#filter "Browse metrics with the Dynatrace metrics browser.") for details.
3. Expand **Details** for any metric to see metric details and a chart of the metric over the selected timeframe. For more information, see [Metrics browser](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/dashboards-classic/metrics-browser "Browse metrics with the Dynatrace metrics browser.").

## Usage

You can use Application Security metrics to

* [Create charts and pin them to your dashboards](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/dashboards-classic/metrics-browser#pin "Browse metrics with the Dynatrace metrics browser.")
* [Query data in Data Explorer](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/explorer#query-components-and-concepts "Query for metrics and transform results to gain desired insights.")

### Example

To view the current status of affected entities in your environment and see how the process of remediating vulnerabilities is developing, create a chart for the `Vulnerabilities - affected entities count` metric and pin it to your dashboard.

## Export and share

Once you run a query in Data Explorer, you can

* [Share metrics results](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/explorer#share "Query for metrics and transform results to gain desired insights.")
* [Export metric results](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/explorer#csv "Query for metrics and transform results to gain desired insights.")
* [Use metric results in API requests](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/explorer#api "Query for metrics and transform results to gain desired insights.")
