Dynatrace Intelligence applies deterministic, causation-based analysis across applications, services, infrastructure, logs, and traces. Using the Grail data lakehouse and the Smartscape real-time dependency graph, it establishes baselines, detects anomalies, and identifies root cause with topology and dependency context. It correlates code changes, deployments, configuration, and policy updates to show what changed and why a problem occurred.

Intelligence can propose and run approved actions through agentic workflows and built-in agents operating under policy guardrails ([Preview](/docs/whats-new/preview-releases#dynatrace-intelligence-agentic-workflows "Learn about our Preview releases and how you can participate in them.")). It supports in-context natural language for investigation and guided next steps, so teams can review findings, open tickets, notify owners, or execute vetted runbooks using the same unified data and context.

## Use cases

For a deeper understanding of how Dynatrace Intelligence can enhance your operations, explore the use cases.

### Developers

* Detect regressions and link them to builds or feature flags.
* Pinpoint root cause with code-level details and stack traces.
* Propose fixes or rollbacks through agentic workflows ([Preview](/docs/whats-new/preview-releases#dynatrace-intelligence-agentic-workflows "Learn about our Preview releases and how you can participate in them.")).

### SRE

* Monitor Kubernetes and cloud with anomaly detection tied to root cause.
* Map impact across dependencies and surface recommended actions.
* Auto-enrich incidents and trigger approved scaling or reconfiguration runbooks.

### Security

* Triage and prioritize vulnerabilities and runtime findings by risk and service context.
* Create tickets and initiate remediation workflows.
* Provide evidence and context to streamline handoffs and resolution.
