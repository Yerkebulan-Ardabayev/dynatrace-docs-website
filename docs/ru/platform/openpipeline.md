# OpenPipeline

* Latest Dynatrace
* Overview
* 1-min read
* Updated on Dec 19, 2025

Dynatrace version 1.295+

OpenPipeline is the Dynatrace data handling solution to seamlessly ingest and process data from different sources, at any scale, and in any format in the Dynatrace Platform.

## Use cases

* Configure ingestion and processing of different configuration scopes, such as logs and events, via a unified solution.
* Scale data management across teams by controlling access and targeted technologies.
* Ensure secure and compliant sensitive data handling.
* Enrich and contextualize data via customizable data processing.
* Optimize data quality and cost control.

## Concepts

[### Data flow
