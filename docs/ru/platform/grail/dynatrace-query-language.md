Dynatrace Query Language (DQL) is a powerful tool to explore your data and discover patterns, identify anomalies and outliers, create statistical modeling, and more based on data stored in [Dynatrace Grail storage](/docs/platform/grail/dynatrace-grail "Grail is the Dynatrace data lakehouse that's designed explicitly for observability and security data and acts as single unified storage for logs, metrics, traces, events, and more.").

DQL offers maximum flexibility because it is built for processing arbitrary event data, requiring no up-front description of the input data's schema contrary to relational databases like SQL tables.

Read [how to use DQL queries](/docs/platform/grail/dynatrace-query-language/dql-guide "Find out how DQL works and what are DQL key concepts.") to get started or explore the language.
