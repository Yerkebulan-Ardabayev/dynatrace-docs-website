Dynatrace Intelligence generative AI is designed to boost productivity, help with onboarding, and enable you to explore data through natural language.

## Dynatrace Intelligence generative AI

Dynatrace Intelligence generative AI is based on a large language model (LLM). The model used by Dynatrace AI generates responses based on your inputs and is probabilistic. This means that the responses are generated by predicting the most probable next word or text, based on the data that they have been created with, and on the provided context. Dynatrace Intelligence generative AI uses the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to provide a foundational LLM with the proper context to transform natural language into a DQL query (in-context learning).

Because of this approach, these models can sometimes behave inaccurately, incompletely, or unreliably. This means there is a risk that the response you receive does not accurately reflect the prompt you provided or that the generated content sounds reasonable but is incomplete or inaccurate.

We recommend that you carefully evaluate the responses you get back from Dynatrace Intelligence generative AI. If the generative AI responds inaccurately, please provide feedback directly from ![Notebooks](https://dt-cdn.net/images/notebooks-768-046137830a.webp "Notebooks") **Notebooks**, ![Dashboards](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-512-b1f1e9690b.png "Dashboards") **Dashboards**, or  **Dynatrace Assist**.

## Generative AI skills overview

Dynatrace Intelligence generative AI service offers distinct and specialized skills. Currently, generative AI offers four skills:

* NL2DQL: this skill powers the **Prompt** quick analysis functionality available in ![Notebooks](https://dt-cdn.net/images/notebooks-768-046137830a.webp "Notebooks") **Notebooks** and ![Dashboards](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-512-b1f1e9690b.png "Dashboards") **Dashboards**. NL2DQL translates your natural language prompts into DQL queries. For details, see [Query with natural language](/docs/dynatrace-intelligence/copilot/quick-analysis-copilot-dql "Use Dynatrace Intelligence generative AI to translate your natural language questions into DQL queries").
* DQL2NL: this skill powers the **Explain query** functionality in ![Notebooks](https://dt-cdn.net/images/notebooks-768-046137830a.webp "Notebooks") **Notebooks** and ![Dashboards](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-512-b1f1e9690b.png "Dashboards") **Dashboards**. DQL2NL provides a summary and an explanation of existing DQL queries to help you better understand DQL. For details, see [Summarize and explain queries](/docs/dynatrace-intelligence/copilot/explain-queries-with-davis-copilot "Learn how to summarize and explain queries using Dynatrace Intelligence generative AI DQL2NL skill.").
* Conversational recommender: this skill powers  **Dynatrace Assist**, our global conversational interface. The conversational recommender is capable of answering your Dynatrace help, onboarding, and usage questions. For details, see [Dynatrace Assist](/docs/dynatrace-intelligence/copilot/chat-with-davis-copilot "Ask questions using natural language and get quick answers from Dynatrace Assist, your generative AI assistant.").

  + **Dynatrace Assist** also offers context-aware conversations in the apps such as ![Problems app - new](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dynatrace-davis-new-256-340162f8c6.webp "Problems app - new") **Problems**, ![Kubernetes (new)](https://dt-cdn.net/images/kubernetes-new-1024-45d3de15d1.webp "Kubernetes (new)") **Kubernetes**, or ![Dashboards](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-512-b1f1e9690b.png "Dashboards") **Dashboards**. Context-aware conversations trigger predefined, contextual prompts and provide you with contextual explanation, remediation steps, and summaries. For details, see [Dynatrace Assist context-aware conversations](/docs/dynatrace-intelligence/copilot/chat-with-davis-copilot/copilot-conv-starters "Learn how to trigger predefined prompts in various Dynatrace applications.").
* Document suggestions: this skill powers the relevant **Troubleshooting Guide** suggestion functionality in ![Problems app - new](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dynatrace-davis-new-256-340162f8c6.webp "Problems app - new") **Problems**. Troubleshooting guide recommendation improves problem resolution by automatically surfacing relevant troubleshooting guides, such as notebooks or dashboards created by your team. For details, see [Discover relevant troubleshooting guides with Dynatrace Intelligence generative AI](/docs/dynatrace-intelligence/copilot/copilot-find-relevant-troubleshooting-guides "Learn how Dynatrace Intelligence generative AI can suggest troubleshooting guides for problem remediation.").

Since the skills offered by Dynatrace Intelligence generative AI are highly specialized, Quick Analysis in ![Notebooks](https://dt-cdn.net/images/notebooks-768-046137830a.webp "Notebooks") **Notebooks** and ![Dashboards](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-512-b1f1e9690b.png "Dashboards") **Dashboards** cannot answer general questions, and  **Dynatrace Assist** might produce inaccurate DQL queries.

## Dynatrace Intelligence generative AI architecture and data flow

Dynatrace Intelligence generative AI uses the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to provide a foundational LLM with the proper context to transform natural language into a DQL query (in-context learning). This means that Dynatrace Intelligence generative AI will enrich your prompt with relevant additional content or context that is sent to the foundational LLM in order to generate an appropriate response. The content or context that is used to enrich your prompt depends on which underlying skill is queried.

The data and additional context is used only to enrich prompts; the model does not learn from this. Customer data isn't used to automatically fine-tune, train, or improve any models or services. For more information, see [How are NL2DQL responses generated?](/docs/dynatrace-intelligence/copilot/quick-analysis-copilot-dql#nl2dql-answers-generation "Use Dynatrace Intelligence generative AI to translate your natural language questions into DQL queries")

## Dynatrace Intelligence generative AI usage limits

There is no limit to the number of interactions you can have with generative AI. However, there is a throughput limit. This means that each user can ask 25 questions in a rolling 15-minute timeframe.

There is a similar limit to how many questions can be asked by all users in your environment simultaneously. Your environment can handle up to 60 questions in a rolling 15-minute timeframe.

If you have exceeded any of the limits, you'll see an error message: "I'm sorry, but I couldn't generate an answer for you because of unusually high demand. Please try again in a minute."
