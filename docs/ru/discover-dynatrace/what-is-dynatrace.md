## Dynatrace architecture

Dynatrace is built for the cloud to be highly scalable, available, and secure.

### Built for the cloud to monitor at hyperscale

Dynatrace is the only solution on the market architected with dynamic, web-scale cloud-native technologies.

Running on public clouds, Dynatrace is built on an elastic grid architecture that scales to 100,000+ hosts easily. We use the most robust enterprise-proven cloud technologies to provide a monitoring solution as resilient and available as the systems it monitors.

* Cloud-native computing
* Cloud-native block and object storage
* Automated load balancing
* Cassandra-based Hypercube storage
* Elasticsearch-based search engine

### Designed for always-on availability

Dynatrace runs across several AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud regions, operating in at least three availability zones for each region.

Automatic scaling and load balancing capabilities ensure that new computing instances spin up automatically to meet spikes in demand and/or traffic.

* Real-time failover redundancy is built into all system components.
* Automated management layer detects faulty components and replaces them immediately.
* One-third of excess capacity in our clusters is always reserved for real-time failover and the ability to cope with peak loads in real time.
* Guaranteed â¥ 99.5% uptime

### Secure by design

Dynatrace has been designed on industry best practices such as encrypted transmissions, cross-site scripting prevention, firewalls, regular security updates, security scans, and vulnerability assessments to ensure the security of your data. Auditing, access restrictions, and secure decommissioning of data storage complement the design.

Because Dynatrace is hosted in the cloud, it benefits from world-class data centers, which are certified for ISO 27001, PCI-DSS Level 1, and SOC 1 / SSAE 16.

Dynatrace has received SOC 2 Type II certification for security and availability.

## Part of your enterprise cloud ecosystem



Dynatrace is integrated with key components of your enterprise cloud ecosystem to support dynamic cloud orchestration on AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, VMware Tanzu Application Service, Red Hat OpenShift, Kubernetes, and others. In these environments, Dynatrace automatically launches and monitors the full cloud stack and all the applications and containers running within the stack, including applications and workloads that may traverse multiple cloud and hybrid environments.

Our close integration with cloud platforms helps you simplify development and operations, increase visibility, and improve situational awareness across hybrid, multicloud environments.
