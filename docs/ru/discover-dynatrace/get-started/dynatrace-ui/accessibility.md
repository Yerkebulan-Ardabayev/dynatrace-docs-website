At Dynatrace, we aspire to provide quality products and services that promote diversity, equality, and inclusion. To achieve this goal, it is essential to follow high accessibility standards that promote the usability of our platform for individuals with disabilities.

* Dynatrace development best practices and accessibility criteria align with **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines** (WCAG), the internationally recognized standard developed by the **World Wide Web Consortium** (W3C).
* The **Voluntary Product Accessibility Template** (VPAT) is a standardized model to document how a product conforms to a set of accessibility standards.
* The VPAT is used to create an **Accessibility Conformance Report** (ACR), which provides details of how a productâs features meet this set of criteria.

Dynatrace works in conjunction with third-party vendors and tools to evaluate our accessibility posture against the WCAG standard, currently [WCAG 2.1 level AAï»¿](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

Our product accessibility journey at Dynatrace is continuous, and we are committed to iterative improvements toward WCAG 2.1 level AA compliance. The ACR linked below represents accessibility status at the time of publishing, so check back for annual updates to this report.

Disclaimer

Any ACR posted below, or anywhere else on the Dynatrace website, or otherwise publicly available, shall not be construed to be included in any contract, either explicitly or implicitly, in whole or in part, absent Dynatrace express acknowledgment through language in the contract itself that such report or its substantive equivalent is included.
