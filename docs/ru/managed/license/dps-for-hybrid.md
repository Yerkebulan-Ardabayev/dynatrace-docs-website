* There is one single annual commitment that is shared across multiple accounts.
* Your order form contains all relevant rate card capabilities for your Managed and/or SaaS deployments.
* On-demand consumption (ODC) is always enabled for all accounts.

License administrators can use [Account Management](/docs/manage/account-management/license-subscription/subscription-overview-dps-hybrid "View your DPS for Hybrid budget summary and cost analysis.") to manage their DPS for Hybrid license.

For more information about DPS in general, see [License Dynatrace](/docs/license "About Dynatrace Platform Subscription (DPS), the licensing model for all Dynatrace capabilities.").

## When DPS for Hybrid is not for you

Here are some use cases where DPS for Hybrid is not the right solution:

## Cost management with DPS for Hybrid

Use the [Subscription overview (DPS for Hybrid)](/docs/manage/account-management/license-subscription/subscription-overview-dps-hybrid "View your DPS for Hybrid budget summary and cost analysis.") to view costs and usage related to your DPS for Hybrid license.

Additionally, you can use forecasts, cost events, and budget alerts to manage your costs.

### Forecasts and cost events

Forecasts and cost events help you manage your DPS for Hybrid budget at the account level.
For more information, see [Customize cost alerts](/docs/license/cost-monitors "Learn how to use the Cost Monitors feature to make forecasts and cost events.").

Note that the following considerations apply for DPS for Hybrid subscriptions:

* Forecasts are only available on the account level.
  It's not possible to get forecasts at the subscription level.
* Forecasts show total costs in absolute terms.
  It's not possible to show forecasts as a percentage of the total DPS commit.

Forecasts and cost events are only estimates and therefore can be misleading in some cases.
Forecasts are based on statistical models and therefore be relied on with caution.

### Budget alerts

Use the Account Management **Budgets** tab to customize your Dynatrace Platform Subscription (DPS) budgets.
For general information about budgets, see [Set budget alerts](/docs/license/budget-alerts "Learn how to configure budgets in Dynatrace.").

Note that the following considerations apply for DPS for Hybrid subscriptions:

* Budgets are defined at the account level.
  It's not possible to define budgets at the subscription level.
* Budget alerts based on percentages won't work.
  You'll need to configure fixed amounts for your budgets.
* If you switch from DPS to DPS for Hybrid, all percentage-based budgets will be deleted in the switch and recipients will be notified via email.
