Dynatrace automatically discovers, baselines, and intelligently monitors dynamic Google Cloud workloads.

## Full-stack monitoring

Dynatrace OneAgent provides full-stack monitoring for core compute resources such as Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Google Compute Engine (GCE), and Google Application Engine (GAE). This gives you deep code-level visibility and end-to-end traces for everything thatâs running on compute services.

## Google Cloud services monitoring

All metrics published to the Operations API (formerly Stackdriver) can be automatically ingested into Dynatrace to provide data for AI-powered problem detection and automatic root cause analysis. Our Google Cloud integration helps you stay on top of the dynamics of your hybrid cloud by providing a high-level overview of the Google Cloud services in your account, distinguishing between healthy and unhealthy services.
