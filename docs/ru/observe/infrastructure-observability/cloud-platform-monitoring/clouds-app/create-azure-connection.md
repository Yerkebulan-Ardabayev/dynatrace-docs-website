If this is the first time you are creating a connection, first see the [onboarding instructions](/docs/ingest-from/microsoft-azure-services/create-an-azure-connection/azure-connection-app-settings "Onboard your Azure environments and create Azure connections via the Settings app.") and its prerequisites.

If you have an existing classic connection and want to start the new cloud platform monitoring, delete the classic connection first and only then create a new cloud connection for the respective Azure subscription.

To set up a new Azure connection

1. Go to ![Clouds](https://dt-cdn.net/images/clouds-1025-170946931c.png "Clouds") **Clouds**.
2. In the upper-right corner of the page, select  **Create connection** > **Azure (Preview)**.

   Note: If it's your first cloud connection, you can also select **Create connection** > **Azure (Preview)** on the landing page.
3. Follow the steps outlined in **New connection** to start the onboarding process for a new Azure cloud connection.

4. After youâve successfully created a new Azure connection, it takes up to 15 minutes to see your cloud inventory on the new **Explorer (Preview)** tab view within ![Clouds](https://dt-cdn.net/images/clouds-1025-170946931c.png "Clouds") **Clouds**.
5. Optional Check the state and health of your cloud connection in ![Settings](https://dt-cdn.net/images/settings-icon-256-38e1321b51.webp "Settings") **Settings**.
