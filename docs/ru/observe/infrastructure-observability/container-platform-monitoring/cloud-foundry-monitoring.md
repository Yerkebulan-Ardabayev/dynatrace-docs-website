Dynatrace supports full-stack monitoring for Cloud Foundry, from the application down to the infrastructure layer.

## Prerequisites

1. [Set up and configure Dynatrace integration on Cloud Foundry](/docs/ingest-from/setup-on-container-platforms/cloud-foundry/deploy-oneagent-on-cloud-foundry "Install OneAgent on Cloud Foundry with BOSH.")
2. [Connect your cluster to Dynatrace](/docs/ingest-from/setup-on-container-platforms/cloud-foundry/connect-your-cloud-foundry-foundations-to-dynatrace "Enable monitoring on your Cloud Foundry foundations.")

See [Cloud Foundry](/docs/ingest-from/setup-on-container-platforms/cloud-foundry "Set up and configure Dynatrace on Cloud Foundry.") for further options and details.

## Monitoring configuration options

[Organize deployments by tags](/docs/observe/infrastructure-observability/container-platform-monitoring/cloud-foundry-monitoring/organize-cf-deployments-by-tags "Automatically organize and filter all your monitored applications by applying tags from your Cloud Foundry environment.").

[Define process group metadata for Cloud Foundry applications](/docs/observe/infrastructure-observability/container-platform-monitoring/cloud-foundry-monitoring/define-process-group-metadata-for-cloud-foundry-applications "Define Cloud Foundry service metadata and reuse it for multiple applications.").
