![Kubernetes (new)](https://dt-cdn.net/images/kubernetes-new-1024-45d3de15d1.webp "Kubernetes (new)") **Kubernetes** enhances the management and monitoring of your Kubernetes environment. It enables a range of functionalities.

* Health and performance monitoring

  + Access detailed views of your clusters that display all critical health signals for resources such as nodes, namespaces, and workloads.
  + Automatically discover, and track the status and performance of, nodes and pods.
  + View metrics, events, and logs from the pods and nodes in a single interface.
  + Gain a high-level overview of all your clusters, regardless of the cloud services they're hosted on.
* Resource efficiency and optimization

  + Understand the overall utilization of resources across your clusters.
  + Identify workloads that are consuming the most resources.
  + Analyze workloads to determine which ones are under-resourced and adjust resource allocations.
