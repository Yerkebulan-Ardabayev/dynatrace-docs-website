All HTML pagesâsuch as static websites or single-page applications running in a browserâare considered web frontends. Below, youâll find everything you need to monitor your web frontendâfrom setup guides to advanced customization options.

Prerequisites

* Ensure you have the permissions described in [New RUM Experience permissions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/permissions "See what permissions you need to set up the New RUM Experience.").
* The minimum supported RUM JavaScript version is RUM JavaScript version 1.329. Older versions starting with RUM JavaScript version 1.317 were part of the preview and do not provide the full set of features. We recommend to update the RUM JavaScript version automatically as described in [Configure the RUM JavaScript version for a frontend](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/additional-configuration/rum-javascript-version#configure-js-version "Learn how to control the RUM JavaScript version used to monitor your frontends in the New RUM Experience.").
* While the minimum required OneAgent version is OneAgent version 1.301+, we recommend using the latest available version, as new features are added regularly.
* Ensure that your infrastructure complies with the [firewall constraints for RUM](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/rum-firewall-latest "Find out how to make sure that Real User Monitoring data passes through your firewall.").
