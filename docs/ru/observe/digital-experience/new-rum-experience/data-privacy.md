The New RUM Experience provides comprehensive data privacy settings designed to help your organization protect end-user personal data and maintain compliance with data protection regulations. While Dynatrace offers these tools, itâs your responsibility to apply them effectively to safeguard your users' information.

## Best Practices

To protect user data, we recommend the following best practices.

1. **Review regulatory requirements:** Ensure your privacy configuration aligns with GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable regulations.
2. **Balance privacy and observability:** Choose settings that safeguard users while maintaining monitoring effectiveness.
3. **Document your choices:** Keep clear records explaining the rationale behind enabling or disabling specific privacy options.
4. **Regular audits:** Periodically review your privacy configurations to maintain compliance.
5. **User transparency:** Communicate data collection practices through privacy policies and consent mechanisms.

## Configuration

The data privacy settings available in RUM Classic are also supported in the New RUM Experience. When you enable the New RUM Experience for an application already instrumented with RUM Classic, your existing data privacy settings are automatically applied.
