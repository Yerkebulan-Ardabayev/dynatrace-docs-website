The New Real User Monitoring (RUM) Experience brings RUM capabilities to the latest Dynatrace and allows you to:

* Gain fine-grained visibility into user frontend activity through [user events](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/concepts/data-model#user-events "Get familiar with the data model at the heart of the New RUM Experience.").
* Investigate individual user journeys and understand user behavior patterns through [user sessions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/concepts/users-sessions-concept "Understand the concepts and terminology related to user sessions in the New RUM Experience.").
* Early Access Automatically capture [user interactions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/concepts/data-model#user-interactions "Get familiar with the data model at the heart of the New RUM Experience.") such as clicks, taps, scrolls, and inputs to gain insights into user behavior.
* Leverage platform apps such as ![Dashboards](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-512-b1f1e9690b.png "Dashboards") **Dashboards**, ![Notebooks](https://dt-cdn.net/images/notebooks-768-046137830a.webp "Notebooks") **Notebooks**, ![Workflows](https://dt-cdn.net/images/workflows-1024-b5708f3cf9.webp "Workflows") **Workflows**, and preinstalled [RUM-specific apps](#new-rum-experience-apps).
* Use [OpenPipeline](/docs/platform/openpipeline "Scale Dynatrace platform data handling with Dynatrace OpenPipeline.") to customize ingested user events and sessions, and extract data and metrics.
* Explore and analyze user events and sessions using the [Dynatrace Query Language](/docs/platform/grail/dynatrace-query-language "How to use Dynatrace Query Language.").
