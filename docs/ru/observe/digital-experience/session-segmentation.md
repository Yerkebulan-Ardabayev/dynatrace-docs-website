Effective user session segmentation is the key to understanding how individual users who share common characteristics experience your application.

A [user session](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-session "Learn how a user session is defined, when a user session starts or ends, how user session duration is calculated, and more."), also called a "visit," "journey," or "clickpath," is any interaction between an individual user's device and your application. Basically, it's a sequence of user actions performed by the same user in your application during a limited period of time. Each user session includes at least one [user action](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-actions "Learn what user actions are and how they help you understand what users do with your application.").
