## Benefits of using ready-made bundles

  This adds context for easier troubleshooting and allows grouping, filtering, and searching by meaningful attributesânot just raw text.
* Improved log structure and metadata for better filtering and querying.
* Simplified setup and processing for new tenants with built-in coverage for standard tech stacks.

## Key advantages

* Logs follow a consistent structure.
* Simplified querying for faster and more accurate results.
* Seamless interpretation across the entire log analysis process.

## Ready-made bundles for popular technologies

The advantages of the **Ingest sources** bundles are the following:

* Provide centralized pre-processing for logs, enabling scalable and flexible handling.
* Automatically applies predefined technology bundles to selected **Ingest sources**, with built-in parsing and enrichment rules.

Technology bundles are automatically applied and can't be customized.
