An action is a generic, reusable function configured and triggered by a [task](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/workflows#concept-task "Automate IT processes with Dynatrace Workflowsâreact to events, schedule tasks, and connect services."). For example, an action could be **Run JavaScript**, while a task would execute the action with a specific configuration to `get problem details` project. Actions are the tools to be assembled in your workflow to fit your custom process. Actions are provided out of the box by Dynatrace and can be installed via Dynatrace Hub.
