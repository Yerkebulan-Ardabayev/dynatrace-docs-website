Use Dynatrace ready-made documents right out of the box.

What's special about ready-made documents

* Created and automatically distributed by Dynatrace as examples and templates.
* Read-only: you can edit them for use during your session, and you can save a copy with your changes, but you can't save your changes to the original document.
* This icon  in a table of documents indicates that it's a ready-made document.

## Using read-only documents

When you open a document (dashboard or notebook) for which you don't have write permission, you can still edit the document during your session. After you're finished, you have two options:

* Save your changes to a new document
* Discard your changes

#### Example in Dashboards

1. Go to ![Dashboards](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-512-b1f1e9690b.png "Dashboards") **Dashboards**, list the ready-made dashboards, and select the **Getting started** dashboard.

   It says  **Ready-made** in the upper-left corner, next to the document name.
2. Select the Pie chart tile and then select  **Edit**.
3. Change the visualization from Pie to Donut.

   Now you are offered two buttons: **Save as new** and **Discard changes**.
4. Use the updated dashboard as needed. You have full edit access for this session.
5. When you're finished, select what to do with your changes:

   * **Save as new**âsaves your changes in a new copy of the edited dashboard.
   * **Discard changes**âdiscards your changes and returns you to the unedited read-only dashboard.

#### Example in Notebooks

1. Go to ![Notebooks](https://dt-cdn.net/images/notebooks-768-046137830a.webp "Notebooks") **Notebooks**, list the ready-made notebooks, and select the **Getting started** notebook.

   It says  **Ready-made** in the upper-left corner, next to the document name.
2. Select the Line chart section and then select  **Options**.
3. Change the visualization from Line to Area.

   Now you are offered two buttons: **Save as new** and **Discard changes**.
4. Use the updated notebook as needed. You have full edit access for this session.
5. When you're finished, select what to do with your changes:

   * **Save as new**âsaves your changes in a new copy of the edited notebook.
   * **Discard changes**âdiscards your changes and returns you to the unedited read-only notebook.
