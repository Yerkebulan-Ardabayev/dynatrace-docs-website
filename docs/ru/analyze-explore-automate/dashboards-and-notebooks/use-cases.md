The following use cases show some of the ways you can use Notebooks and Dashboards to leverage visualization and analysis of data ingested into Grail.

### Analyze and report with security snippets

Application Security

In this use case, you use snippets to visualize exposure to vulnerabilities, prioritize remediation efforts, and communicate findings to owning teams.

* [Built-in security query snippets](/docs/secure/use-cases#snippets "Use case scenarios for Application Security and Threat Observability.")

### Determine threat exposure with security templates

Application Security

In this use case, you use the Threat exposure template to visualize the risk and impact of vulnerabilities (Dashboards) or analyze the impact of vulnerabilities and prioritize remediation efforts (Notebooks).

* [Out-of-the-box templates](/docs/secure/use-cases#templates "Use case scenarios for Application Security and Threat Observability.")
