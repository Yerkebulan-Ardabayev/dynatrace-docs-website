Log Monitoring Classic

For the newest Dynatrace version, see [Log ingestion API](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/logs/lma-log-ingestion/lma-log-ingestion-via-api "Stream log data to Dynatrace using API and have Dynatrace transform it into meaningful log messages.").

Dynatrace automatically collects log and event data from a vast array of technologies. With the Log ingestion API, you can stream log records to a system, and have Dynatrace transform the stream into meaningful log messages.

The Log ingestion API allows you to stream log records to the system. It is available via [Ingest JSON and TXT logs (Logs Classic)](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/log-monitoring/acquire-log-data/logs-classic-ingestion-api/log-classic-ingest-json-txt-logs "Understand how JSON and TXT logs are processed.") or via [Ingest OTLP logs](/docs/ingest-from/opentelemetry/otlp-api/ingest-logs "Learn how Dynatrace ingests OpenTelemetry log records and what limitations apply.").

* For Dynatrace SaaS, the Log ingestion endpoint is available in your environment.

* If the Environment ActiveGate is your choice for an endpoint in your local environment, install an ActiveGate instance:

In Dynatrace Hub, select **ActiveGate** > **Set up**.

The Log ingestion API v2 is automatically enabled on ActiveGate. ActiveGate is responsible for serving the endpoint, collecting the data, and forwarding it to Dynatrace in batches.

* Saas endpoints:

  + `https://{your-environment-id}.live.dynatrace.com/api/v2/logs/ingest`
  + `https://{your-environment-id}.live.dynatrace.com/api/v2/otlp/v1/logs`

* Environment ActiveGate endpoints:

  + `https://{your-activegate-domain}:9999/e/{your-environment-id}/api/v2/logs/ingest`
  + `https://{your-activegate-domain}:9999/e/{your-environment-id}/api/v2/otlp/v1/logs`

## Log data queue on Environment ActiveGate

You can customize the log data queue properties by editing the `custom.properties` file (see [Configuration properties and parameters of ActiveGate](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/configuration/configure-activegate#generic-ingest "Learn which ActiveGate properties you can configure based on your needs and requirements.")) on your ActiveGate to set the following values:

```
[generic_ingest]



#disk_queue_path=<custom_path> # defaults to temp folder



#disk_queue_max_size_mb=<limit> # defaults to 300 MB
```

503 Usable space limit reached

The log data ingestion API returns a `503 Usable space limit reached` error when the ingested log data exceeds the configured queue size. Typically, this is a temporary situation that occurs only during spikes. If this error persists, increase the value of `disk_queue_max_size_mb` in `custom.properties` to allow log ingestion spikes to be queued.

## Example

In this example, the API request ingests log data that will create a log event with defined log attributes `content`, `status`, `service.name`, and `service.namespace`.

The API token is passed in the Authorization header.

The response contains response code `204`.
