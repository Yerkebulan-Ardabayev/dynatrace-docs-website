## Get started

![Smartscape](https://dt-cdn.net/images/smartscapes-256-eb41c7cddc.png "Smartscape") **Smartscape** is an interactive map of your digital ecosystem powered by [**Smartscape on Grail**](/docs/platform/grail/smartscape-on-grail "Learn about Smartscape on Grail features and how Smartscape uses the power of DQL."). Use it to visually analyze topology and relationships between all of your entities in real time with the help of customized ![Smartscape](https://dt-cdn.net/images/smartscapes-256-eb41c7cddc.png "Smartscape") **Smartscape** views and modals.

## Use cases

* **Smartscape on Grail:** Explore your entire digital ecosystem end-to-end with a unified model that connects everything from services to infrastructure for a complete architectural context.
* **Clouds overview:** Gain a unified, real-time topology of AWS EC2 instances and surrounding components to analyze security posture, optimize costs, and validate architecture.
* **Kubernetes:** Gain full-stack visibility by mapping clusters, namespaces, and components. Detect misconfigurations and troubleshoot issues across workloads.
* **Problems Graph:** Instantly understand root cause and blast radius by mapping anomalies to impacted entities and dependency chains.
* **Service Dependency Graph:** Trace call flows, isolate performance hotspots, and uncover unexpected communication paths for better service reliability.
* **Infrastructure:** Navigate a real-time map of hosts, VMs, and network relationships to validate architecture, diagnose infrastructure-driven issues, and spot bottlenecks or drift patterns.
