# Segments

# Segments

* Latest Dynatrace
* Overview
* 1-min read
* Published Mar 29, 2023

Use segments to logically structure and conveniently filter observability data across apps on the Dynatrace platform.

## Use cases

Segments are typically modeled to allow filtering monitored entities, logs, metrics, events, and other types of data about the following dimensions:

* Business applications operated by the customer
* Organizational units, to understand responsibility and ownership
* Infrastructural components, to understand and plan the allocation of resources

## Concepts

[### Includes

Learn how data of different types can be included in segments.](/docs/manage/segments/concepts/segments-concepts-includes "Learn how data of different types can be included in segments.")[### Variables

Learn how to leverage variables in segments.](/docs/manage/segments/concepts/segments-concepts-variables "Learn how variables help to form dynamic segments and reduce configuration effort and maintenance.")[### Visibility

Learn how to control visibility of segments.](/docs/manage/segments/concepts/segments-concepts-visibility "Learn how to control the visibility of segments.")[### Queries

Learn how Grail evaluates segments during query execution.](/docs/manage/segments/concepts/segments-concepts-queries "Learn how Grail evaluates segments during query execution to return matching results only.")

## Getting started

[### Analyze monitoring data
