A Dynatrace Platform Subscription (DPS) agreement is typically signed for 1â3 years, with a minimum annual commitment.
Each platform capability has a price point defined in the rate card that's included with your agreement.

Your organization's usage of each Dynatrace capability accrues costs towards your annual commitment as defined in the rate card.
**Account Management** provides daily updates about accrued usage and related costs.
You can access these details anytime via [Account Management](/docs/manage/account-management "Manage your Dynatrace license, subscriptions, and platform adoption and environment health.") or the [Dynatrace Platform Subscription API](/docs/dynatrace-api/account-management-api/dynatrace-platform-subscription-api "Query the data about your Dynatrace Platform Subscription via the Account Management API.").

Once your annual commitment is reached, you can continue to use Dynatrace while incurring on-demand usage.
Dynatrace applies the same rate card for on-demand usage without additional fees or premium pricing.
You receive monthly invoices for on-demand costs until the next annual commitment period begins.

Your [DPS Billing report](/docs/license/billing-reports "View your billing to see details about accrued costs per booking date. Use this view to determine which Dynatrace monitoring costs were recognized and booked on which day.") is available in the Dynatrace web UI at **Subscription** > **Billing report**.
Your billing report provides details about accrued costs per booking date.
