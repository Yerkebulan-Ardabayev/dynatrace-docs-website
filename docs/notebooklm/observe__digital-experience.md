# Configure key user actions for custom applications

# Configure key user actions for custom applications

* How-to guide
* 1-min read
* Published Jan 30, 2023

Most applications include user actions that are particularly important to the success of your digital business. Examples of these actions are signups, checkouts, and product searches. Such [key user actions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-actions#key-user-actions "Learn what user actions are and how they help you understand what users do with your application.") might take longer to execute than others, or they might have the requirement to be of a shorter-than-average duration.

With the key user action feature, you can [customize the Apdex thresholds](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/scores-and-ratings/apdex-ratings#key-user-actions "Learn how Dynatrace uses Apdex to measure user satisfaction with application performance.") for each of these user actions. You can use this feature to monitor key actions with a dedicated dashboard tile and track historical trends.

## Mark a user action as a key user action

1. Go to **Frontend**.
2. Select the application and scroll down to **Top 3 user actions** or **Top 3 actions**.
3. Select **View full details** or **Analyze performance**.
4. Scroll down to see the list of user actions, and select the required user action.  
   The user action detail page opens.
5. In the upper-right corner of the user action detail page, select **Mark as key user action**.

You can define up to 500 key user actions per environment across all your applications and up to 100 key user actions per application.

When you reach the maximum key user action limit, consider using calculated metrics (available for your [web](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/rum-calculated-metrics-web "Create calculated metrics as well as custom charts based on calculated metrics for your web applications."), [mobile](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/rum-calculated-metrics-mobile "Create calculated metrics as well as custom charts based on calculated metrics for your mobile applications."), and [custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/additional-configuration/rum-calculated-metrics-custom "Create calculated metrics as well as custom charts based on calculated metrics for your custom applications.")), which offer similar capabilities.

## Pin a key user action to dashboard

[Dashboards Classic](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/dashboards-classic "Learn how to create, manage, and use Dynatrace Dashboards Classic.")

1. Go to **Frontend**.
2. Select the application and scroll down to **Top 3 user actions** or **Top 3 actions**.
3. Select **View full details** or **Analyze performance**.
4. Search for the required key user action and select it.  
   The user action detail page opens.
5. In the upper part of the user action detail page, select **Pin to dashboard**. For details, see [Pin tiles to your dashboard](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/dashboards-classic/charts-and-tiles/pin-tiles-to-your-dashboard "Learn to pin tiles to your dashboards.").

# Define user action and user session properties for custom applications

# Define user action and user session properties for custom applications

* How-to guide
* 1-min read
* Published Jan 27, 2022

Dynatrace captures a lot of information about the performance of your applications. You can enrich this information with valuable metadata and then convert the metadata into user action and user session properties.

Action and session properties are metadata key-value pairs that you can filter across Dynatrace analysis views. These properties come in handy when you need to create powerful queries, segmentations, or aggregations on the captured metadata. You can use these properties on the **User sessions** and **User sessions query** pages. For a deeper understanding of how to leverage these properties, see [Leverage user action and user session properties for custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/analyze-and-use/action-and-session-properties-custom "User action and session properties, which are metadata key-value pairs, provide added visibility and deeper analysis of your end users' experience. Using these properties for your applications, you can filter user sessions, add calculated metrics, create charts, and more.").

Below you can find the information on how to configure such properties as well as related configuration examples. To exploit action and session properties, you first need to send the required metadata to Dynatrace and then [add properties in the Dynatrace web UI](#add-properties).

## Send metadata to Dynatrace

Before you can define action and session properties, you first need to start transferring the required metadata to Dynatrace. There are two ways of doing this:

* [Report custom values via SDK](#report-value-sdk)
* [Define request attributes](#add-request-attribute)

### Report a value via SDK

You can report metadata key-value pairs in the source code of your custom app via an API call. For details, see [Dynatrace OpenKit API methods | Report a value](/docs/ingest-from/extend-dynatrace/openkit/dynatrace-openkit-api-methods#report-values "Read how Dynatrace OpenKit can be used from the developer's point of view.").

To check if the data that you report in your app's code reaches Dynatrace, go to the details of the user action that should contain the data, and scroll down to the **Reported values** section.

![User action details page with SDK-reported values](https://dt-cdn.net/images/user-action-details-with-reported-values-2048-b44e8bca3e.png)

### Define a request attribute

Additionally, you can add the required metadata to server-side requests, define request attributes, and then use these attributes to create action and session properties.

Request attributes are derived from web request URLs, HTTP request headers, and other request metadata. These attributes represent key-value pairs that you can filter across many Dynatrace analysis and distributed tracing views.

For more details, see [Request attributes](/docs/observe/application-observability/services/request-attributes "Understand what request attributes are and learn how to use them across all levels of all service-analysis views.").

## Add action and session properties

After you've reported values via your app's code or defined request attributes, the information that Dynatrace captures is enriched with valuable metadata. You can "promote" this metadata to action and session properties in your app's settings.

You can save the metadata on different "storage levels":

* **User action property**: The data is stored in the defined property on the user action level for each user action where Dynatrace can retrieve the metadata.
* **User session property**. The most recent captured value is stored in the defined property on a session level.
* **Both options**: The data is stored in the defined property on both the user action and session levels.

To define an action or session property

1. Go to **Frontend** and select the application that you want to configure.
2. Select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
3. From the application settings, select **Session and user action properties**, and select **Add property**.
4. Select an **Expression type** and, if required, a **Data type**.

   * If you've added metadata to requests and [defined request attributes](#add-request-attribute), select **Server-side request attribute**.
   * If you've [reported custom values via SDK](#report-value-sdk), select **SDK reported value**.
5. Specify a **Name** or **Request attribute name**, **Display name**, and **Key**.

   | Option | Explanation |
   | --- | --- |
   | Name Request attribute name | For the SDK-reported value type, it's the name of the reported value from your application's code. **Name** is case-sensitive, so it must exactly match the entry from your code. For the server-side request attribute type, it's the name of the request attribute set in **Settings** > **Server-side service monitoring** > **Request attributes**. |
   | Display name | The name of the property that is used in the Dynatrace web UI, for example, on the session details page or user action details page. |
   | Key | The name of the property that is used to identify and later locate the property in [USQL](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/custom-queries-segmentation-and-aggregation-of-session-data "Learn how you can access and query user session data based on keywords, syntax, functions, and more."). |
6. Choose at least one [storage type](#storage-levels)âuser action property, session property, or both.
7. For the session property storage type, select one of the aggregation types.
8. Optional To restrict the captured values, enable **Apply cleanup rule**, and specify a [regular expression](/docs/manage/tags-and-metadata/reference/regular-expressions-in-dynatrace "Learn how to use regular expressions in the context of Dynatrace.").

## Examples of action and session properties

Below you can find examples of several action and session properties that we've configured for our easyTravel sample web application.

Journey ID

Member status

Total purchase amount

Credit card

![Journey ID](https://dt-cdn.net/images/property-journey-id-2136-1e20f89c85.png)

The **Journey ID** property, which contains a `long` data type value, is added to each user action and user session within the easyTravel app. For a user session, the value of the last user action is saved.

![Member status property](https://dt-cdn.net/images/property-member-status-2136-1665ea176c.png)

The **Member status** property captures a loyalty program membership status for the whole session. In this case, we do not care about individual user actions as loyalty status is usually the same for the whole session.

![Purchase amount property](https://dt-cdn.net/images/property-purchase-amount-2136-8a92eff1b1.png)

The **Total purchase amount** property represents the total price of all journeys booked via our easyTravel app. Note that this session property is actually the sum of `purchase_amount` values from multiple user actions.

![Credit card type property](https://dt-cdn.net/images/property-credit-card-type-2136-8a271f7d47.png)

The **Credit card type** is an example of how we've "promoted" a server-side request attribute to action and session properties.

## Limitations

* You can define a maximum of 200 properties per application.
* You can define a maximum of 20 action properties per application.
* Action and session properties of the `String` data type are limited to 100 characters after applying the cleanup rule.
* You can use up to 20 properties per application free of charge. Additional properties consume DEM units.
  See [DEM units](/docs/license/monitoring-consumption-classic/digital-experience-monitoring-units#dem-units "Understand how Dynatrace Digital Experience Monitoring consumption is calculated based on DEM units.") (pay attention to the **Session property** and **Action property** entries in the table) and [Free tier of action and session properties](/docs/license/monitoring-consumption-classic/digital-experience-monitoring-units#free-action-and-session-properties "Understand how Dynatrace Digital Experience Monitoring consumption is calculated based on DEM units.") for more information.

## Notes

* Dynatrace begins capturing action and session properties only after you [define these properties in your app's settings](#add-properties).
* You can check how many properties you're already using and how many more you can add. Go to your app settings > **Session and user action properties**, and scroll down to **Property usage quotas**.

# Effective customer support with session segmentation

# Effective customer support with session segmentation

* Tutorial
* 8-min read
* Published Oct 03, 2023

Your customer support department probably receives thousands of support tickets every year, maybe every month. Some of these tickets require detailed insights into the customer's workflow to determine where the problem occurred and solve the case. Drilling into customer issuesâsuch as slowly loading webpages, unresponsive UI, or various request and JavaScript errorsâis cumbersome and takes a long time to resolve, especially when the information is missing.

Thanks to [session segmentation](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation "Learn how to use Real User Monitoring to analyze user sessions across your applications."), however, getting your customers out of trouble is easier and quicker.

With session segmentationâalso known as user session analysisâyou get full visibility into how your users experience every digital transaction across web, mobile, and custom applications. You can categorize your application's user sessions into meaningful groups based on shared characteristics, such as an operating system, browser type, or location.You can also find specific users and sessions via advanced filtering attributes, which is very beneficial for resolving customer support requests.

Session segmentation enables your customer support to:

* Reduce the resolution time of customer support tickets.
* Save your time and your customers' time.
* Experience an easier troubleshooting process.
* Prevent customer frustration and improve your customer satisfaction rating.

## Scenario

Let's see how your customer support experts can leverage session segmentation when working on support tickets and resolving customer complaints.

For this use case, imagine that your customer, Daniel Adams, creates a support ticket stating that your website is very slow and that there was some kind of an error. He has neither mentioned the exact page nor provided details on the error.

The sections below explain how to find a specific customer's session, study its details, and get even more insights via waterfall analysis and distributed traces.

![Effective customer support with session segmentation](https://dt-cdn.net/images/effective-customer-support-with-session-segmentation-2500-c91eb011c1.png)

## Find the problematic session

After receiving customer feedback, the first important step is to check the problematic [user session](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-session "Learn how a user session is defined, when a user session starts or ends, how user session duration is calculated, and more.") to understand what went wrong. If you've leveraged [user tagging](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#user-tagging "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace."), it's very easy to find the session of the person who submitted a support ticket. With user tags, which are comprised of a username, nickname, or email, you can analyze a specific user's behavior and experience via [user session analysis](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/new-user-sessions "Learn about user session segmentation and filtering attributes.").

To view problematic user sessions of a particular user

1. In Dynatrace, go to ![Session Segmentation](https://dt-cdn.net/images/session-segmentation-512-5278e8fa16.png "Session Segmentation") **Session Segmentation**.
2. Use the [timeframe selector](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/dashboards-classic/dashboards/dashboard-timeframe "Learn about Dynatrace dashboard timeframe and management zone settings.") in the upper-right corner of the page to set the analysis timeframe to the date and time when the issue occurred.
3. Select the **Filter by** box at the top of the page, and set the following [filtering attributes](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/new-user-sessions#session-segmentation-filters "Learn about user session segmentation and filtering attributes."). Once you select an attribute, the possible values for that attribute are displayed.

   * **Application**: **<your application name>**
   * **User tag**: **<tag of the user who reported the issue>**
   * **User experience score**: **Frustrating** if the user complained of a slow UI
   * **Has errors**: **Yes** if the user reported an error

   The list of user sessions updates to show the sessions that match the filtering attributes that you've set.
4. Select a timestamp of the required user session to navigate to the session details page.

In the example below, you can see a session entry for Daniel Adams. The session started at 15:13 on September 27, 2023, lasted for 25 seconds, and contained one error.

![Session list with a filtered out session](https://dt-cdn.net/images/session-list-3468-904af7eb49.png)

## Explore the session details

The session details page provides valuable information on the user session, for example, the session start time, duration, and [user experience score](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/scores-and-ratings/user-experience-score "User experience score is a metric used to categorize user sessions as Frustrating, Tolerable, or Satisfying."). On this page, you can also find important device-related information such as the screen resolution, browser, operating system, IP address, and more.

![Session details - overview](https://dt-cdn.net/images/session-details-overview-2572-a75b75baba.png)

* Under **Analysis**, check the user session timeline. Errors and annoyances are marked with red color.

  ![Session details - timeline](https://dt-cdn.net/images/session-details-timeline-2572-cb5979cee6.png)
* Scroll down to the **Events and actions** section to see what [actions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-actions "Learn what user actions are and how they help you understand what users do with your application.") the user performed and what [user and error events](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace.") happened during the session.

  ![Session details - events and actions](https://dt-cdn.net/images/session-details-events-and-actions-2572-53614392e0.png)
* Filter actions and events by action type, [Apdex rating](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/scores-and-ratings/apdex-ratings "Learn how Dynatrace uses Apdex to measure user satisfaction with application performance."), [error type](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#error "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace."), or even [conversion goal](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/define-conversion-goals "Learn how to analyze conversion goals for specific user actions to understand how successfully you're meeting your conversion milestones.").

  ![Session details - filter by different parameters](https://dt-cdn.net/images/session-details-filter-by-2572-c48481918a.png)
* **Expand** ![Expand row](https://dt-cdn.net/images/expand-row-icon-9c4950fc2e.svg "Expand row") the required action or event to view more details.

  In our example, you can see that a request error happened during the `loading of page /cart/checkout` [load action](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-actions#load-action "Learn what user actions are and how they help you understand what users do with your application."), and the Apdex rating for this action is **Frustrating**.

  ![Session details - action details](https://dt-cdn.net/images/session-details-action-details-separated-2572-e1bd2d75c9.png)

## Watch the session recording

A [Session Replay](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-replay "Learn how you can use Session Replay to better understand and troubleshoot errors experienced by your customers.") recording, if available for a user session, offers an enhanced level of insight into your user's journey. Session Replay can capture and visually replay each click or tap made within your application, creating an immersive movie-like experience. This feature helps to resolve customer complaints, reproduce production issues, improve overall usability, or fix application bugs.

To watch a session recording

1. On the session details page, in the **Analysis** section, go to the **Session Replay** tab.
2. Select **Play** ![Replay](https://dt-cdn.net/images/replay-button-optimized-41ad05863e.svg "Replay"), and watch the recording of the user session.
3. Use the Session Replay controls to carefully examine the actions that the user performed in your application. Note that the errors are represented by red dots in the timeline.

![Session details - session replay](https://dt-cdn.net/images/session-details-session-replay-3468-f6b7e8e699.png)

## Check request waterfall graphs

After watching the session recording, let's investigate the issue further using waterfall analysis and identify a specific request to blame.

[Waterfall analysis](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/waterfall-analysis "Learn how to analyze all user action monitoring data through waterfall analysis.") proves to be invaluable in analyzing the performance of a user action and getting detailed information about various requests that comprise a user action. Waterfall graphs come in handy when you want to find a specific request that is responsible for failures or performance violations, while [top findings](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/waterfall-analysis#top-findings "Learn how to analyze all user action monitoring data through waterfall analysis.") streamline the captured data into easily understandable and actionable information, simplifying the troubleshooting process.

To view waterfall graphs for a user action

1. On the session details page, under **Events and actions**, find and expand the action that caused the trouble. Such an action is marked with a red line, and its Apdex rating is usually **Frustrating**.
2. In the lower-right corner of the action details, select **Perform waterfall analysis** to navigate to the action waterfall graphs.
3. On the action waterfall analysis page, study the available information.

   ![Waterfall analysis](https://dt-cdn.net/images/waterfall-analysis-3468-32efcffec9.png)

   * Hover over the requests that happened during the action and check various [user action metrics](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-action-metrics "Learn what metrics Dynatrace calculates for user actions and find out what each metric indicates.").
   * Select **Show all findings** to view and analyze all of them at once.
   * Select each finding to get additional information on it. When you select a finding, the associated requests and resources are highlighted in the waterfall.
4. Select the **# Error** finding. The associated erroneous requests and resources are highlighted in the waterfall.

In our example, we've selected the **1 Error** finding and learned that the `/checkout` request failed with the `HTTP 500` error.

![Waterfall analysis - failed request](https://dt-cdn.net/images/waterfall-analysis-failed-request-3468-c8adab59ed.png)

## Explore distributed traces

After you've grasped the summary of the situation from the **Waterfall analysis** view, it's time to drill down to code-level information. Let's view the distributed traces of the failed request to investigate the timing, code-level context, and downstream call details.

[PurePathÂ® technology](/docs/observe/application-observability/distributed-traces "Gain observability into highly distributed, cloud-native architectures to effectively trace and analyze transactions in real time.") traces each web request through your application infrastructure, offering valuable insights into performance factors at the application level. For instance, if you see that one or two requests are consuming most of the action time, you can drill into the distributed trace to discern whether the issue stems from an abundance of database requests or a single slow one. With this data, you can enhance the application performance or conduct in-depth error analysis to optimize your system.

To view distributed traces of a request

1. On the action waterfall analysis page, select the failed request, which is in red, and check the available details.
2. Select **View trace** to navigate to the distributed traces page for that request.
3. In the distributed traces list view, select a resource or request and drill down to the [available details](/docs/observe/application-observability/distributed-traces/use-cases/segment-request#pp-analysis "Enhance your distributed system performance by segmenting requests with slow response time via Service flow and analyzing their distributed traces.").

![Distributed traces for the checkout request](https://dt-cdn.net/images/distributed-traces-3468-4f297a5b46.png)

On the distributed traces page, you can check the response time, processing time, execution breakdown, and [request attributes](/docs/observe/application-observability/services/request-attributes "Understand what request attributes are and learn how to use them across all levels of all service-analysis views."). When required, you can study the trace logs, view the failure details, or navigate to the [**Service flow**](/docs/observe/application-observability/services-classic/service-flow "Find out how Dynatrace can help you trace the sequence of service calls that are triggered by each service request in your environment.") or [**Service backtrace**](/docs/observe/application-observability/services-classic/service-backtrace "Trace the sequence of service calls all the way back up to the browser click that triggered the sequence of calls.") view.

By checking the **Logs** and **Errors** tabs on the distributed traces page, we've finally found out that there was an issue with Daniel Adams's credit card: its details were invalid.

```
failed to charge card: could not charge the card: rpc error: code = Code(400) desc = Credit card info is invalid
```

![Distributed traces - error details](https://dt-cdn.net/images/error-details-2358-41cc3abebe.png)

## Resolve the issue

Now that you know the whole storyâwhat, when, and whereâit's time to eliminate a problem that might have caused your client frustration. Whether it's a broken HTML tag, an outdated JavaScript code, or a user interface issue, your development team now knows where to start.

# Configure key user actions for mobile applications

# Configure key user actions for mobile applications

* How-to guide
* 1-min read
* Published Jan 30, 2023

Most applications include user actions that are particularly important to the success of your digital business. Examples of these actions are signups, checkouts, and product searches. Such [key user actions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-actions#key-user-actions "Learn what user actions are and how they help you understand what users do with your application.") might take longer to execute than others, or they might have the requirement to be of a shorter-than-average duration.

With the key user action feature, you can [customize the Apdex thresholds](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/scores-and-ratings/apdex-ratings#key-user-actions "Learn how Dynatrace uses Apdex to measure user satisfaction with application performance.") for each of these user actions. You can use this feature to monitor key actions with a dedicated dashboard tile and track historical trends.

## Mark a user action as a key user action

1. Go to **Frontend**.
2. Select the application and scroll down to **Top 3 user actions** or **Top 3 actions**.
3. Select **View full details** or **Analyze performance**.
4. Scroll down to see the list of user actions, and select the required user action.  
   The user action detail page opens.
5. In the upper-right corner of the user action detail page, select **Mark as key user action**.

You can define up to 500 key user actions per environment across all your applications and up to 100 key user actions per application.

When you reach the maximum key user action limit, consider using calculated metrics (available for your [web](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/rum-calculated-metrics-web "Create calculated metrics as well as custom charts based on calculated metrics for your web applications."), [mobile](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/rum-calculated-metrics-mobile "Create calculated metrics as well as custom charts based on calculated metrics for your mobile applications."), and [custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/additional-configuration/rum-calculated-metrics-custom "Create calculated metrics as well as custom charts based on calculated metrics for your custom applications.")), which offer similar capabilities.

## Pin a key user action to dashboard

[Dashboards Classic](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/dashboards-classic "Learn how to create, manage, and use Dynatrace Dashboards Classic.")

1. Go to **Frontend**.
2. Select the application and scroll down to **Top 3 user actions** or **Top 3 actions**.
3. Select **View full details** or **Analyze performance**.
4. Search for the required key user action and select it.  
   The user action detail page opens.
5. In the upper part of the user action detail page, select **Pin to dashboard**. For details, see [Pin tiles to your dashboard](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/dashboards-classic/charts-and-tiles/pin-tiles-to-your-dashboard "Learn to pin tiles to your dashboards.").

## Customize Apdex rating for a key user action

To change the Apdex thresholds for a key user action

1. Go to **Frontend**.
2. Select the application and scroll down to **Top 3 user actions** or **Top 3 actions**.
3. Select **View full details** or **Analyze performance**.
4. Search for the required key user action and select it.  
   The user action detail page opens.
5. In the upper-right corner of the user action detail page, do one of the following:

   * For web applications, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit** > **Key performance metric**.
   * For mobile and custom applications, select ![Expand](https://dt-cdn.net/images/expandbutton-40-e1f11ff81d.png "Expand") (**Expand**) > **Edit** > **Key performance metric**.
6. Use the slider to adjust the Apdex thresholds.

# Define user action and user session properties for mobile applications

# Define user action and user session properties for mobile applications

* How-to guide
* 2-min read
* Published Jan 27, 2022

Dynatrace captures a lot of information about the performance of your applications. You can enrich this information with valuable metadata and then convert the metadata into user action and user session properties.

Action and session properties are metadata key-value pairs that you can filter across Dynatrace analysis views. These properties come in handy when you need to create powerful queries, segmentations, or aggregations on the captured metadata. You can use these properties on the **User sessions** and **User sessions query** pages. For a deeper understanding of how to leverage these properties, see [Leverage user action and user session properties for mobile applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/analyze-and-use/action-and-session-properties-mobile "User action and session properties, which are metadata key-value pairs, provide added visibility and deeper analysis of your end users' experience. Using these properties for your applications, you can filter user sessions, add calculated metrics, create charts, and more.").

Below you can find the information on how to configure such properties as well as related configuration examples. To exploit action and session properties, you first need to send the required metadata to Dynatrace and then [add properties in the Dynatrace web UI](#add-properties).

## Send metadata to Dynatrace

Before you can define action and session properties, you first need to start transferring the required metadata to Dynatrace. There are two ways of doing this:

* [Report custom values via SDK](#report-value-sdk)
* [Define request attributes](#add-request-attribute)

### Report a value via SDK

You can report custom values in the source code of your mobile app via an API call. Our native SDKs and plugins for cross-platform frameworks offer a variant of the `reportValue` call to do this.

[Android](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-oneagent-sdk/oneagent-sdk-for-android#report-value) [iOS](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/oneagent-sdk-for-ios#report-value) [React Native](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dynatrace/react-native-plugin#report-values) [Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/dynatrace_flutter_plugin#reportValues) [Xamarin](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/cross-platform-frameworks/xamarin-nuget#report-values) [![.NET MAUI](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dotnetmaui-aea483621e.svg ".NET MAUI").NET MAUI](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/cross-platform-frameworks/maui#report-values) 

To report values for the native part of Cordova apps, follow the instructions for Android or iOS. For the web part, use the [RUM JavaScript API](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/customize-rum "Find out how to customize Real User Monitoring using the JavaScript API.").

You can report values of the following data types:

| Framework | `int` | `long` | `double` | `string` | `date` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Android | Applicable | Applicable | Applicable | Applicable | Not applicable |
| iOS | Applicable | Not applicable | Applicable | Applicable | Not applicable |
| React Native | Applicable | Not applicable | Applicable | Applicable | Not applicable |
| Flutter | Applicable | Not applicable | Applicable | Applicable | Not applicable |
| Xamarin | Applicable | Not applicable | Applicable | Applicable | Not applicable |
| .NET MAUI | Applicable | Not applicable | Applicable | Applicable | Not applicable |
| Cordova (web part) RUM JavaScript API | Not applicable | Applicable | Applicable | Applicable | Applicable |

To check if the data that you report in your app's code reaches Dynatrace, go to the details of the user action that should contain the data, and scroll down to the **Reported values** section.

![User action details page with SDK-reported values](https://dt-cdn.net/images/user-action-details-with-reported-values-2048-b44e8bca3e.png)

### Define a request attribute

Additionally, you can add the required metadata to server-side requests, define request attributes, and then use these attributes to create action and session properties.

Request attributes are derived from web request URLs, HTTP request headers, and other request metadata. These attributes represent key-value pairs that you can filter across many Dynatrace analysis and distributed tracing views.

For more details, see [Request attributes](/docs/observe/application-observability/services/request-attributes "Understand what request attributes are and learn how to use them across all levels of all service-analysis views.").

## Add action and session properties

After you've reported values via your app's code or defined request attributes, the information that Dynatrace captures is enriched with valuable metadata. You can "promote" this metadata to action and session properties in your app's settings.

You can save the metadata on different "storage levels":

* **User action property**: The data is stored in the defined property on the user action level for each user action where Dynatrace can retrieve the metadata.
* **User session property**. The most recent captured value is stored in the defined property on a session level.
* **Both options**: The data is stored in the defined property on both the user action and session levels.

To define an action or session property

1. Go to **Frontend** and select the application that you want to configure.
2. Select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
3. From the application settings, select **Session and user action properties**, and select **Add property**.
4. Select an **Expression type** and, if required, a **Data type**.

   * If you've added metadata to requests and [defined request attributes](#add-request-attribute), select **Server-side request attribute**.
   * If you've [reported custom values via SDK](#report-value-sdk), select **SDK reported value**.
5. Specify a **Name** or **Request attribute name**, **Display name**, and **Key**.

   | Option | Explanation |
   | --- | --- |
   | Name Request attribute name | For the SDK-reported value type, it's the name of the reported value from your application's code. **Name** is case-sensitive, so it must exactly match the entry from your code. For the server-side request attribute type, it's the name of the request attribute set in **Settings** > **Server-side service monitoring** > **Request attributes**. |
   | Display name | The name of the property that is used in the Dynatrace web UI, for example, on the session details page or user action details page. |
   | Key | The name of the property that is used to identify and later locate the property in [USQL](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/custom-queries-segmentation-and-aggregation-of-session-data "Learn how you can access and query user session data based on keywords, syntax, functions, and more."). |
6. Choose at least one [storage type](#storage-levels)âuser action property, session property, or both.
7. For the session property storage type, select one of the aggregation types.
8. Optional To restrict the captured values, enable **Apply cleanup rule**, and specify a [regular expression](/docs/manage/tags-and-metadata/reference/regular-expressions-in-dynatrace "Learn how to use regular expressions in the context of Dynatrace.").

## Examples of action and session properties

Below you can find examples of several action and session properties that we've configured for our easyTravel sample web application.

Journey ID

Member status

Total purchase amount

Credit card

![Journey ID](https://dt-cdn.net/images/property-journey-id-2136-1e20f89c85.png)

The **Journey ID** property, which contains a `long` data type value, is added to each user action and user session within the easyTravel app. For a user session, the value of the last user action is saved.

![Member status property](https://dt-cdn.net/images/property-member-status-2136-1665ea176c.png)

The **Member status** property captures a loyalty program membership status for the whole session. In this case, we do not care about individual user actions as loyalty status is usually the same for the whole session.

![Purchase amount property](https://dt-cdn.net/images/property-purchase-amount-2136-8a92eff1b1.png)

The **Total purchase amount** property represents the total price of all journeys booked via our easyTravel app. Note that this session property is actually the sum of `purchase_amount` values from multiple user actions.

![Credit card type property](https://dt-cdn.net/images/property-credit-card-type-2136-8a271f7d47.png)

The **Credit card type** is an example of how we've "promoted" a server-side request attribute to action and session properties.

## Limitations

* You can define a maximum of 200 properties per application.
* You can define a maximum of 20 action properties per application.
* Action and session properties of the `String` data type are limited to 100 characters after applying the cleanup rule.
* You can use up to 20 properties per application free of charge. Additional properties consume DEM units.
  See [DEM units](/docs/license/monitoring-consumption-classic/digital-experience-monitoring-units#dem-units "Understand how Dynatrace Digital Experience Monitoring consumption is calculated based on DEM units.") (pay attention to the **Session property** and **Action property** entries in the table) and [Free tier of action and session properties](/docs/license/monitoring-consumption-classic/digital-experience-monitoring-units#free-action-and-session-properties "Understand how Dynatrace Digital Experience Monitoring consumption is calculated based on DEM units.") for more information.

## Notes

* Dynatrace begins capturing action and session properties only after you [define these properties in your app's settings](#add-properties).
* You can check how many properties you're already using and how many more you can add. Go to your app settings > **Session and user action properties**, and scroll down to **Property usage quotas**.

# Leverage user action and user session properties for mobile applications

# Leverage user action and user session properties for mobile applications

* How-to guide
* 1-min read
* Published Jan 27, 2022

User action properties and user session properties provide a powerful and flexible means of adding information to each user action and user session. You can leverage these properties for deeper visibility into all the details of your users' interactions with your application.

Action and session properties are metadata key-value pairs that are derived from captured data. This metadata is "promoted" from SDK-reported values or request attributes. Action and session properties come in handy when you need to create powerful queries, segmentations, or aggregations on captured metadata. You can also use these properties on the **User sessions** and **User sessions query** pages.

See the sections below to learn where you can find the values that are captured as user action and session properties and how you can take full advantage of these properties.

Before you can leverage user action and session properties, you need to define these properties in your application settings. For details, see [Define user action and user session properties for mobile applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/define-mobile-action-and-session-properties "Send metadata to Dynatrace and define action and session properties for your monitored mobile applications.").

## User session analysis

The **[User sessions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/new-user-sessions "Learn about user session segmentation and filtering attributes.")** page offers the option to filter user sessions by action and session properties. For example, if you're running a loyalty program, you can add a `loyalty_status` property to learn whether a user in a monitored user session is a `Silver`, `Gold`, or `Platinum` member. You can then filter for `Platinum` or `Gold` customers on the **User sessions** page.

1. Go to ![Session Segmentation](https://dt-cdn.net/images/session-segmentation-512-5278e8fa16.png "Session Segmentation") **Session Segmentation**.
2. In **Filter by**, select one of the property types, for example, **Session date properties** or **User action string properties**, and then choose the required property.
3. Select the property value or values according to your needs.
4. Select a session to view its details and the available session properties.
5. From the user session details page you can drill down into user actions. Expand a user action, and then select **Perform waterfall analysis**. From this page, you can check the available action properties as well as all reported values.

   ![User action analysis](https://dt-cdn.net/images/user-action-analysis-1639-89f7ffac81.png)
6. In the upper-right corner, select **Analyze user action** to dive even deeper. Under **User action properties**, select the action property for further analysis.

## Additional insights with USQL

User action and session properties can greatly improve your analytics capabilities when using the [Dynatrace User Sessions Query Language (USQL)](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/custom-queries-segmentation-and-aggregation-of-session-data "Learn how you can access and query user session data based on keywords, syntax, functions, and more.") for analytics that require advanced filtering or persistent filtering across analysis views. Also, when you want to keep track of the monetary values and conversion goals that are key to the success of your business, you can construct queries based on the unique values of the individual user action or session properties that have been defined for your environment.

To use action and session properties in USQL

1. Go to ![Query user sessions](https://dt-cdn.net/images/query-user-sessions-512-77c5a8da9f.png "Query user sessions") **Query User Sessions**.
2. Enter the required query. The following custom properties are available:

   | Custom property | Table | Action property | Session property |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | `<dataType>Properties.<propertyKey>` | `useraction` | Applicable |  |
   | `<dataType>Properties.<propertyKey>` | `usersession` |  | Applicable |
   | `useraction.<dataType>Properties.<propertyKey>` | `useraction` | Applicable |  |
   | `useraction.<dataType>Properties.<propertyKey>` | `usersession` | Applicable |  |
   | `usersession.<dataType>Properties.<propertyKey>` | `useraction` |  | Applicable |
   | `usersession.<dataType>Properties.<propertyKey>)` | `usersession` |  | Applicable |

   The `<dataType>` part can take the following values:

   * `string`
   * `long`
   * `double`
   * `date`
3. Select **Run query**.

In the example below, you can see how many request errors the Silver, Gold, and Platinum customers have faced.

```
SELECT stringProperties.loyalty_status AS "Loyalty status", COUNT(useraction.requestErrorCount) AS "HTTP error count" FROM usersession WHERE stringProperties.loyalty_status IS NOT NULL GROUP BY stringProperties.loyalty_status
```

![Gain additional insights with USQL](https://dt-cdn.net/images/use-properties-usql-1642-60372d3301.png)

## Integration via User session API

The [User sessions API](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/user-sessions "Learn what the Dynatrace User Sessions Query language API offers."), in combination with our [User Sessions Query Language (USQL)](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/custom-queries-segmentation-and-aggregation-of-session-data "Learn how you can access and query user session data based on keywords, syntax, functions, and more."), enables you to access all user action and session data, including properties and values.

Extending the loyalty program example above, you can leverage the problem information and loyalty status information via the User session API by querying the user sessions that were impacted by the problem after the problem was closed. This allows you to use the information to, for example, set up personalized marketing campaigns.

Here are some sample queries you may want to leverage:

* Gold member user sessions on an application within a certain timeframeâyou can leverage this for problems that impact an entire application.

  ```
  SELECT userId, stringProperties.loyalty_status FROM usersession WHERE stringProperties.loyalty_status = "Gold" AND userType = "REAL_USER" AND useraction.application = "easyTravel" AND startTime > 1531741985241 AND endTime < 1531932305287
  ```
* Platinum member users on a specific application hitting a specific page within a certain timeframeâyou can leverage this for problems that impact a specific page.

  ```
  SELECT userId, stringProperties.loyalty_status, useraction.targetUrl FROM usersession WHERE stringProperties.loyalty_status = "Platinum" AND userType = "REAL_USER" AND useraction.application = "easyTravel" AND startTime > 1531741985241 AND endTime < 1531932305287 AND useraction.targetUrl = "https://easytravel.perform-2018.dynalabs.io/special-offers.jsp"
  ```

## Dashboards

For web, mobile, and custom applications, you can [create a query](#usql) with action and session properties and then pin the resulting chart to one of your dashboards.

For web applications, you can additionally create calculated metrics based on custom properties, use these metrics to create a chart and then pin this chart to your dashboards. This can be done in [Data Explorer](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/explorer "Query for metrics and transform results to gain desired insights.").

The generic **Web property pack** is used in the following example to track the marketing campaigns on [Dynatrace.comï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/) to view the following:

* Overall traffic by continent
* Top campaigns by continent
* Slowest landing experience by marketing campaign

![Web property pack](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dynatrace-com-marketing-campaigns-anonym-1600x951-1600-59971b5148.png)

## Session properties export

You can export captured user session properties, along with all other user session data, within user session export streams.

For more details, see [Export user sessions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/export-session-data "Set up Dynatrace to export user session data to a provided webhook endpoint.").

# Instrument mobile apps with Dynatrace Cordova plugin

# Instrument mobile apps with Dynatrace Cordova plugin

* How-to guide
* 5-min read
* Updated on Oct 12, 2022

Hybrid mobile apps combine the benefits of native mobile apps, such as phone hardware and deployment via an app store, with the flexibility and platform independence of modern web technologies.

The Dynatrace Cordova plugin allows you to instrument apps that are built on top of Apache Cordova. This includes apps that use Capacitor, Ionic, or IBM mobile first. The Cordova plugin makes it easy to monitor your hybrid apps using the following technologies:

* OneAgent for Mobile, which monitors the native part of your app
* RUM JavaScript, which monitors the performance of the web-based part of your app

For detailed technical documentation, see the [Dynatrace Cordova pluginï»¿](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dynatrace/cordova-plugin) page on the npm site.

## Set up hybrid mobile app monitoring

1. In Dynatrace, go to **Mobile**.
2. Select **Create mobile app**.
3. Enter a name for your application and select **Create mobile app**. The application settings page opens.
4. From the application settings, select **Instrumentation wizard** and select your mobile app platform, for example, **Cordova**.

   ![Creating an app in Dynatrace](https://dt-cdn.net/images/setup-wizard-1764-763c621790.png)
5. Enter the `cordova plugin add @dynatrace/cordova-plugin --save` command in the root directory of your Cordova-based project to install the Dynatrace Cordova plugin.
6. Select **Monitor the web view** to enable the web view monitoring.
7. Select **Download dynatrace.config.js**, and add the downloaded file to the root of your Cordova app workspace next to the `config.xml` file.
8. Build your project using `cordova build android` or `cordova build ios`.

When you build your Android or iOS app, the Cordova plugin automatically instruments your app using OneAgent for Mobile, which monitors the native part of your hybrid app. This provides visibility into app starts, user actions, crash reports, and device metadata such as model and OS version. The monitoring data collected by OneAgent for Mobile is encapsulated in a mobile app in Dynatrace.

To capture user actions in web views, Dynatrace uses the [RUM JavaScript](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case"), which is also used for all web applications that are [set up for agentless Dynatrace monitoring](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/set-up-agentless-real-user-monitoring "Set up agentless monitoring for your web applications."). The Cordova plugin automatically injects the RUM JavaScript directly into your HTML sources. The monitoring data collected by the RUM JavaScript is encapsulated in a web application in Dynatrace. This application receives all monitoring data and generates an API token so that the Cordova plugin can retrieve the RUM JavaScript from the REST API.

![Cordova app instrumentation](https://dt-cdn.net/images/instrumentcordovaapp-1913-f1c90c1409.png)

## Start monitoring and analyzing your app

1. Launch your hybrid app in an emulator or on a test device, and click through the use cases to generate some traffic that Dynatrace can monitor. When you're done, close your app to ensure that all data is sent to Dynatrace. Note that OneAgent for Mobile may cache the data for up to 2 minutes.
2. In Dynatrace, go to **Mobile**.
3. Select your new hybrid app from the list of applications.

   All performance analysis metrics data related to your app is displayed on your hybrid app's overview page. The **Hybrid app** section displays the overall details of the performance of the web portion of your app.

   ![Analyze mobile apps](https://dt-cdn.net/images/analyze-mobile-app-1954-6c4199ccdd.png)
4. Select **View web application** to analyze performance data that Dynatrace captures via the injected RUM JavaScript.

   The web application overview page contains user actions that are captured in the web view, so you'll find a high percentage of your app's user actions listed here.

   ![Analyze web apps](https://dt-cdn.net/images/analyze-web-app-1954-d5e81e0ff9.png)

   Performance data is split across two application views. However, Dynatrace consolidates all detected user actions from these application views to a single user and a single user session.
5. Go to ![Session Segmentation](https://dt-cdn.net/images/session-segmentation-512-5278e8fa16.png "Session Segmentation") **Session Segmentation** to access the **User sessions** page. In the **Filtered by** field, enter **Application**, and select your hybrid mobile app, which allows you to focus analysis on your newly created app.
6. Select the default user created for your hybrid app from the **User** column. Notice that this user has accessed two appsâa mobile app and a web app.

   ![Analyze user](https://dt-cdn.net/images/analyze-user-1950-e23a310611.png)
7. Select a user session. You should see that all user actions captured in the mobile and web part of your hybrid app have been combined into a single session, along with the metadata that enables Dynatrace to show which user actions were captured by OneAgent for Mobile and which were captured by the RUM JavaScript.

   The following chart shows the sequence of user actions, when they occurred during a user session, and the wait time between the actions.

   ![Joined user session](https://dt-cdn.net/images/joined-user-session-1571-0684cc8268.png)

From here, you can continue with your user-experience analysis. You can add additional filters to focus on the sessions you want to take a closer look at, or you can drill down to the user action waterfalls of your app's web and mobile sessions.

# Instrument mobile apps with Dynatrace .NET MAUI NuGet package

# Instrument mobile apps with Dynatrace .NET MAUI NuGet package

* How-to guide
* 10-min read
* Updated on Sep 25, 2024

Dynatrace version 1.265+

The Dynatrace .NET MAUI NuGet package helps auto-instrument your .NET MAUI mobile application with OneAgent for Android and iOS as well as provides an API for [manual instrumentation](#usage-mobile-agent).

The Dynatrace .NET MAUI NuGet package is available for Android and iOS. You cannot use our package for macOS and Windows.

## Supported features

#### Auto-instrumentation

* User actions
* Lifecycle events
* Web requests
* Crashes

#### Manual instrumentation

* Custom actions
* Web requests
* Values
* Events
* Errors
* Crashes
* User tagging

## Requirements

* **For Android:** Android version 5.0+ (API 21+)
* **For iOS:** iOS version 12+

## Set up the package

Perform the following steps to set up the Dynatrace .NET MAUI NuGet package for your mobile application.

[![Step 1](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-1-086e22066c.svg "Step 1")

**Install the Dynatrace .NET MAUI NuGet package**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/cross-platform-frameworks/maui#install-package "Monitor .NET MAUI applications with Dynatrace OneAgent.")[![Step 2](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-2-1a1384627e.svg "Step 2")

**Create an application and get the config file**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/cross-platform-frameworks/maui#installation-dynatrace "Monitor .NET MAUI applications with Dynatrace OneAgent.")[![Step 3](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-3-350cf6c19a.svg "Step 3")

**Add the config file to your project**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/cross-platform-frameworks/maui#configure-app "Monitor .NET MAUI applications with Dynatrace OneAgent.")[![Step 4](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-4-3f89d67d41.svg "Step 4")

**Add the OneAgent start method**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/cross-platform-frameworks/maui#start-method "Monitor .NET MAUI applications with Dynatrace OneAgent.")[![Step 5 optional](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dotted-step-5-52040ae237.svg "Step 5 optional")

**Enable automatic web request instrumentation**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/cross-platform-frameworks/maui#http-client "Monitor .NET MAUI applications with Dynatrace OneAgent.")

### Step 1 Install the NuGet package

Add the Dynatrace .NET MAUI NuGet package to your application.

1. In Visual Studio, right-click the solution of your mobile application and select **Manage NuGet packages**.
2. Find [**Dynatrace.OneAgent.MAUI** from nuget.orgï»¿](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dynatrace.OneAgent.MAUI) and select **Add Package**.
3. Select the checkboxes of all the projects to which you want to add the NuGet package. Make sure you're adding the package to your native projects, as the target files within our package interact with the build.
4. Select **OK**.

### Step 2 Create an application and get the config file

Create a new mobile application in Dynatrace and download the configuration file.

1. In Dynatrace, go to **Mobile**.
2. Select **Create mobile app**.
3. Enter a name for your application and select **Create mobile app**. The application settings page opens.
4. From the application settings, select **Instrumentation wizard** > **.NET MAUI**.
5. Under step 2, select **Download dynatrace.config.json** to get the configuration file.

### Step 3 Add the config file to your project

Add the [`dynatrace.config.json` file](#config-file), which you downloaded in the previous step, to your project.

Android

iOS

Add the `dynatrace.config.json` file to the `Platforms/Android/Assets` directory of your project.

If you cannot find the `Assets` directory, create it inside the `Platforms/Android` directory.

Add the `dynatrace.config.json` file to the `Platforms/iOS/Resources` directory of your project.

Before each build, our package automatically creates a new `Dynatrace.plist` file based on the options set in your configuration file.

If you cannot find the `Resources` directory, create it inside the `Platforms/iOS` directory.

### Step 4 Add the OneAgent start method

The start method is required for OneAgent to start.

Android

iOS

```
using Dynatrace.MAUI;



Agent.Instance.Start();
```

```
using Dynatrace.MAUI;



Agent.Instance.Start();
```

### Step 5 optional Enable automatic web request instrumentation Optional

You can optionally use the following method to enable the auto-instrumentation of web requests. The `HttpMessageHandler` used by `HttpClient` takes care of the manual web request instrumentation.

```
using Dynatrace.MAUI;



var httpHandler = Agent.Instance.GetHttpMessageHandler();



var httpClient = new HttpClient(httpHandler);
```

Moreover, you can also have your own HTTP handler:

```
using Dynatrace.MAUI;



var defaultHttpHandler = new HttpClientHandler();



var httpHandler = Agent.Instance.GetHttpMessageHandler(defaultHttpHandler);



var httpClient = new HttpClient(httpHandler);
```

## Manual instrumentation

The sections below describe how to start OneAgent manually, create custom actions, instrument web requests, and report values, events, and crashes.

### Start OneAgent

You can use the manual startup with a configuration builder (Android) or a configuration dictionary (iOS).

1. Modify the [`dynatrace.config.json` file](#config-file) to disable OneAgent autostart.

   Android

   iOS

   ```
   {



   "android": {



   "autoStart": {



   "enabled": false



   }



   }



   }
   ```

   ```
   {



   "ios": {



   "DTXAutoStart": false



   }



   }
   ```

   Don't add additional properties to the configuration file. If you do that, the build fails with an exception.
2. Start OneAgent manually and pass the required properties.

   Android

   iOS

   ```
   using Dynatrace.MAUI;



   Agent.Instance.Start(new ConfigurationBuilder("<insertBeaconURL>","<insertApplicationID>").BuildConfiguration());
   ```

   ```
   using Dynatrace.MAUI;



   Agent.Instance.Start(new ConfigurationBuilder("<insertBeaconURL>","<insertApplicationID>").BuildConfiguration());
   ```

### Create custom actions

You can create custom actions and enhance them with additional information such as values, events, and errors.

Call `EnterAction` to start a custom action and `LeaveAction` to close a custom action. Timing is measured automatically.

```
using Dynatrace.MAUI;



IRootAction myAction = Agent.Instance.EnterAction("Tap on Confirm");



//Perform the action and whatever else is needed.



myAction.LeaveAction();
```

For a mobile custom action or a mobile autogenerated user action, the maximum name length is 250 characters.

Check the following links for information on user action naming: [Android](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/monitoring-capabilities#user-action-naming "Configure the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin to adjust the monitoring capabilities of OneAgent.") and [iOS](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/oneagent-sdk-for-ios#user-action-naming "Enrich mobile user experience monitoring using OneAgent SDK for iOS.").

When the [user opt-in mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile#opt-in-mode-mobile "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.") is enabled for your application, it might affect user tagging and reporting of custom events, user actions, values, and errors. The exact data types not reported to Dynatrace depend on the data collection level set by a particular user. For details, refer to [Data collection levels](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile#data-collection-levels "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.").

### Create child actions

Besides generating standalone custom actions, you can also create [child actions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-actions#child-actions "Learn what user actions are and how they help you understand what users do with your application.").

Child actions are similar to parent custom actions. When a parent action is closed, all child actions of the parent action are automatically closed.

```
using Dynatrace.MAUI;



IRootAction myAction = Agent.Instance.EnterAction("Tap on Confirm");



IAction mySubAction = myAction.EnterAction("Tap on Confirm again");



//Perform the action and whatever else is needed.



mySubAction.LeaveAction();



myAction.LeaveAction();
```

For a mobile custom action or a mobile autogenerated user action, the maximum name length is 250 characters.

There's no limit on the number of child actions attached to a custom action. However, note that you can have only one level of child actionsâyou can't create a child action for another child action (child actions can't have their own child actions). Also, refer to [User session structure for individual user](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-session#session-structure-dep-on-app-type "Learn how a user session is defined, when a user session starts or ends, how user session duration is calculated, and more.").

Child actions are not displayed on the [user session details page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/new-user-sessions#session-details-page "Learn about user session segmentation and filtering attributes."), but you can view them on the [waterfall analysis page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/waterfall-analysis "Learn how to analyze all user action monitoring data through waterfall analysis.") for a custom action to which these child actions are attached.

### Cancel custom actions

If you need to cancel an already created but not yet closed custom action, call `Cancel`. Canceling an action discards all data associated with it: all reported values, events, and errors are discarded; all child actions are canceled.

```
using Dynatrace.MAUI;



IRootAction myAction = Agent.Instance.EnterAction("Tap on Confirm");



// Action is canceled



myAction.Cancel();
```

You can't cancel a closed action, so calling `Cancel` after `LeaveAction` is impossible for the same action. The same goes for closing a canceled action: you can't call `LeaveAction` after using `Cancel` for the same action.

### Instrument web requests

Use the following code snippet to instrument web requests:

```
using Dynatrace.MAUI;



// Create an action



IRootAction webAction = Agent.Instance.EnterAction(actionName: "WebRequest Action");



// Generate a new unique tag associated with the web request action



string requestTag = webAction.GetRequestTag(url);



string requestTagHeader = webAction.GetRequestTagHeader();



// Place the Dynatrace HTTP header on your web request



httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add(requestTagHeader, requestTag);



// Generate a WebRequestTiming object based on the unique tag



IWebRequestTiming timing = Agent.Instance.GetWebRequestTiming(requestTag, url);



// Start web request timing before the HTTP request is sent



timing.StartWebRequestTiming();



try



{



var response = await httpClient.GetAsync(url);



// Stop web request timing when the HTTP response is received and the response body is obtained



timing.StopWebRequestTiming(url, (int)response.StatusCode, response.ReasonPhrase);



}



catch (HttpRequestException exception)



{



// Stop web request timing when a connection exception occurs



timing.StopWebRequestTiming(url, -1, exception.ToString());



}



finally



{



// Leave an action



webAction.LeaveAction();



}
```

### Report a value

The `reportValue` method allows you to report key-value pairs of metadata that you can later view in the Dynatrace web UI and convert into [user action and user session properties](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/analyze-and-use/action-and-session-properties-mobile "User action and session properties, which are metadata key-value pairs, provide added visibility and deeper analysis of your end users' experience. Using these properties for your applications, you can filter user sessions, add calculated metrics, create charts, and more."). The reported values must be part of a user action.

You can report values of the following data types:

* `int`
* `double`
* `string`

```
ReportValue(valueName: string, value: int);



ReportValue(valueName: string, value: double);



ReportValue(valueName: string, value: string);
```

For instance, to report a `string` value within the `Tap on Confirm` action, use the following code:

```
using Dynatrace.MAUI;



IRootAction myAction = Agent.Instance.EnterAction("Tap on Confirm");



myAction.ReportValue("Customer type", "Gold");



myAction.LeaveAction();
```

To view the reported values in the Dynatrace web UI, go to the details of the user action that should contain that metadata and scroll down to the **Reported values** section.

![User action details page with SDK-reported values](https://dt-cdn.net/images/user-action-details-with-reported-values-2048-b44e8bca3e.png)

To add action and session properties based on the reported values and then use these properties to create powerful queries, segmentations, and aggregations, see [Define user action and user session properties for mobile applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/define-mobile-action-and-session-properties "Send metadata to Dynatrace and define action and session properties for your monitored mobile applications.").

When the [user opt-in mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile#opt-in-mode-mobile "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.") is enabled for your application, it might affect user tagging and reporting of custom events, user actions, values, and errors. The exact data types not reported to Dynatrace depend on the data collection level set by a particular user. For details, refer to [Data collection levels](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile#data-collection-levels "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.").

### Report an event

For any open action, you can report an event. Use the following API call:

```
ReportEvent(eventName: string);
```

If you want to report standalone events with lots of additional information, see [Report a business event](#report-business-event).

When the [user opt-in mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile#opt-in-mode-mobile "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.") is enabled for your application, it might affect user tagging and reporting of custom events, user actions, values, and errors. The exact data types not reported to Dynatrace depend on the data collection level set by a particular user. For details, refer to [Data collection levels](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile#data-collection-levels "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.").

### Report an error

To report an [error](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#error "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace."), use the `ReportError` method.

```
ReportError(errorName: string, errorCode: number);
```

When the [user opt-in mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile#opt-in-mode-mobile "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.") is enabled for your application, it might affect user tagging and reporting of custom events, user actions, values, and errors. The exact data types not reported to Dynatrace depend on the data collection level set by a particular user. For details, refer to [Data collection levels](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile#data-collection-levels "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.").

### Report an error stack trace

To report an error stack trace, use the following API call:

```
using Dynatrace.MAUI;



Agent.Instance.ReportErrorStacktrace("Error_Class", "Error_Value", "Error_Reason", "Error_Stacktrace");
```

### Report a crash

To report a [crash](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#crash "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace."), use the following API call.

```
using Dynatrace.MAUI;



Agent.Instance.ReportCrash("CrashWithoutException", "Crash_Reason", "Crash_Stacktrace");
```

You can also use an exception object:

```
using Dynatrace.MAUI;



Agent.Instance.ReportCrashWithException("CrashWithExceptionObj", exception);
```

The time when the crash details are sent to Dynatrace depends on your mobile application operating system.

* **Android**

  In general, the crash details are sent immediately after the crash, so the user doesnât have to relaunch the application. However, in some cases, the application should be reopened within 10 minutes so that the crash report is sent. Note that Dynatrace doesn't send crash reports that are older than 10 minutes (as such reports can no longer be correlated on the Dynatrace Cluster).
* **iOS**

  The crash details are sent only when the user reopens the mobile application (so on the next application launch). However, if the user doesn't open the application within 10 minutes, the crash report is deleted. This is because Dynatrace doesn't send crash reports that are older than 10 minutes (as such reports can no longer be correlated on the Dynatrace Cluster).

Reporting a crash forces a user session to be completed. Any subsequent actions are included in a new user session.

Android only When you use automated crash reporting, Visual Studio might catch the exception before OneAgent. If you notice that Dynatrace doesn't report crashes to your environment, make sure that [you're not using the debug option in Visual Studio](#debugger-turn-off). Otherwise, the debugger catches the crash and nothing is reported to your Dynatrace environment.

### Report a business event

With `sendBizEvent`, you can report business events. These are standalone events, as Dynatrace sends them separately from user actions or user sessions.

Business events are only captured for monitored sessions. When OneAgent is disabled either through a special flag or due to [cost and traffic control](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-cost-and-traffic-control-mobile "Leverage the cost and traffic control setting in Dynatrace to reduce session usage for mobile apps."), business events are not reported for such sessions. Note that this behavior might be subject to change in the future, potentially allowing business events to be sent to Dynatrace regardless of session monitoring.

For additional details on business events, refer to [Business Observability](/docs/observe/business-observability "Basic concepts, setup and configuration, and use cases for Dynatrace Business Observability").

```
using Dynatrace.MAUI;



var attributes = new Dictionary<string, JsonValue>();



attributes.Add("event.name", "Confirmed Booking");



attributes.Add("screen", "booking-confirmation");



attributes.Add("product", "Danube Anna Hotel");



attributes.Add("amount", 358.35);



attributes.Add("currency", "USD");



attributes.Add("reviewScore", 4.8);



attributes.Add("arrivalDate", "2022-11-05");



attributes.Add("departureDate", "2022-11-15");



attributes.Add("journeyDuration", 10);



attributes.Add("adultTravelers", 2);



attributes.Add("childrenTravelers", 0);



Agent.Instance.SendBizEvent("com.easytravel.funnel.booking-finished", attributes);
```

### Tag specific users

You can tag each user of your mobile application with a unique user name. This enables you to search and filter specific user sessions and analyze individual user behavior over time. For more details, see [User tagging](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#user-tagging "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace.").

Make the following API call to tag the current session with a particular name:

```
using Dynatrace.MAUI;



Agent.Instance.IdentifyUser("John Smith");
```

OneAgent for Android version 237+ OneAgent for iOS version 235+ Sessions split due to idle or duration timeout are re-tagged automatically.

When OneAgent ends a tagged session because the session duration has reached its set limit or due to the user's inactivity, the subsequent session is re-tagged automatically. You don't need to provide the user identification information again.

However, note that OneAgent does not re-tag the subsequent session in the following cases:

* When you explicitly end a tagged user session via [`endVisit`](#end-session)
* When the user or the mobile operating system closes or force stops the app
* When OneAgent ends the current user session and generates a new session after the privacy settings have been changed

See [User sessions > Session end](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-session#user-session-end--mobile-apps "Learn how a user session is defined, when a user session starts or ends, how user session duration is calculated, and more.") to learn when OneAgent ends a mobile user session.

When the [user opt-in mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile#opt-in-mode-mobile "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.") is enabled for your application, it might affect user tagging and reporting of custom events, user actions, values, and errors. The exact data types not reported to Dynatrace depend on the data collection level set by a particular user. For details, refer to [Data collection levels](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile#data-collection-levels "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.").

### End a session

You can force a session to end via the API call. This also closes all open actions and starts a new session.

```
using Dynatrace.MAUI;



Agent.Instance.EndVisit();
```

### Configure data privacy (opt-in mode)

With user opt-in mode, each user of your application can set their data privacy preferences and decide whether they want or don't want to share their information. When the opt-in mode is enabled, you need to ask each user for permission to capture their data; then, you store their data privacy preferences. For details, see [User opt-in mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile#opt-in-mode-mobile "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.").

#### Enable user opt-in mode

To activate the user opt-in mode, set the `userOptIn` property (Android) or [`DTXUserOptIn` configuration key](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys#privacy-and-security "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.") (iOS) to `true` in the [`dynatrace.config.json` file](#config-file).

#### Retrieve user's data privacy preferences

You can retrieve the data privacy preferences of a particular user.

To get the current `UserPrivacyOptions` configuration, use the following API call:

```
using Dynatrace.MAUI;



// Get the UserPrivacyOptions object



UserPrivacyOptions currentOptions = Agent.Instance.GetUserPrivacyOptions();



// Get the individual settings for DataCollectionLevel and crash reporting



bool crashOptedIn = Agent.Instance.GetUserPrivacyOptions().CrashReportingOptedIn;



DataCollectionLevel dataCollectionLevel = Agent.Instance.GetUserPrivacyOptions().DataCollectionLevel;
```

#### Change user's data privacy preferences

You can adjust the data privacy preferences based on the decision of a particular user.

To set new options on a `UserPrivacyOptions` object, use the following code:

```
using Dynatrace.MAUI;



// Creating a new UserPrivacyOptions object requires setting the two parameters of DataCollectionLevel and crash reporting



UserPrivacyOptions options = new UserPrivacyOptions(DataCollectionLevel.Performance, false);



// Update the options with the setter



// Set a data collection level (user allowed you to capture performance and personal data)



options.DataCollectionLevel = DataCollectionLevel.UserBehavior;



// Allow crash reporting (user allowed you to collect information on crashes)



options.CrashReportingOptedIn = true;



// Get the values of the configuration with the getter



options.DataCollectionLevel;



options.CrashReportingOptedIn;



// Get the UserPrivacyOptions object



UserPrivacyOptions currentOptions = Agent.Instance.GetUserPrivacyOptions();
```

To apply the new `UserPrivacyOptions` configuration, use this code:

```
using Dynatrace.MAUI;



UserPrivacyOptions options = new UserPrivacyOptions(DataCollectionLevel.UserBehavior, true);



Agent.Instance.ApplyUserPrivacyOptions(options);
```

The possible values for the [data collection level](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile#data-collection-levels "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.") are as follows:

* `Off`
* `Performance`
* `UserBehavior`

### Report GPS location

You can report the latitude and longitude.

```
SetGPSLocation(latitude: double, longitude: double);
```

## Instrumentation Overhead

When using auto-instrumentation through our plugin, here are some examples of the size differences before and after instrumentation for release builds.

| Operating System | App template | Version | Size Before | Size After | Difference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Android | Default new app | net8.0-android | 31.8 MB | 32.4 MB | 0.6 MB |
| iOS | Default new app | net8.0-ios | 421 MB | 426.2 MB | 5.2 MB |

## Configuration file

The `dynatrace.config.json` configuration file contains your application ID, beacon URL, and some other settings.

* You can [download this file from Dynatrace](#installation-dynatrace) or create it manually.
* If you don't add a configuration file with at least the beacon URL and the application ID properties, the build fails. Alternatively, use the [manual startup](#start-agent) with a configuration builder (Android) or a configuration dictionary (iOS).
* When you use a specific build configurationâfor example, `Debug`, `Release`, or a custom-defined configurationâour package searches the `Assets` (Android) or `Resources` (iOS) directory for a configuration file named `dynatrace<Configuration>.config.json`. For example, if you're using the `Debug` build configuration, our package looks for a file named `dynatraceDebug.config.json`.
* If you want to specify a custom path for your configuration, set it via the `DynatraceConfigurationFile` property.

  Create `Directory.Build.props` in the Android/iOS (or general) project directory:

  ```
  <Project>



  <PropertyGroup>



  <DynatraceConfigurationFile>CUSTOM_PATH/dynatrace.config.json</DynatraceConfigurationFile>



  </PropertyGroup>



  </Project>
  ```

In summary, this results in the following order in which the configuration will be used:

1. Custom configuration path through `DynatraceConfigurationFile` property
2. Configuration-specific file like `dynatrace<Configuration>.config.json`
3. Default name `dynatrace.config.json`

The following is the `dynatrace.config.json` file structure for Android and iOS.

Android

iOS

```
{



"android": {



"autoStart": {



"applicationId": "<insertApplicationID>",



"beaconUrl": "<insertBeaconURL>"



},



"userOptIn": true,



"agentBehavior": {



"startupLoadBalancing": true



}



}



}
```

```
{



"ios": {



"DTXApplicationId": "<insertApplicationID>",



"DTXBeaconUrl": "<insertBeaconURL>",



"DTXUserOptIn": true,



"DTXStartupLoadBalancing": true



}



}
```

Never use dot notation for the configuration file. Always write in full bracket style.

## Enable OneAgent debug logs

If the instrumentation runs through and your application starts, but you see no data in your Dynatrace environment, you probably need to dig deeper to find out why OneAgents aren't sending any data. Opening up a support ticket is a great idea but gathering logs first is even better.

Android

iOS

Update your [`dynatrace.config.json` file](#config-file) to enable OneAgent debug logs.

```
{



"android": {



"autoStart": {



"applicationId": "<insertApplicationID>",



"beaconUrl": "<insertBeaconURL>"



},



"userOptIn": true,



"debug": {



"agentLogging": true



}



}



}
```

Add the following configuration snippet to the [`dynatrace.config.json` file](#config-file):

```
{



"ios": {



"DTXApplicationId": "<insertApplicationID>",



"DTXBeaconUrl": "<insertBeaconURL>",



"DTXUserOptIn": true,



"DTXLogLevel": "ALL"



}



}
```

## Enable build debug logs for Android

Android only

If the Android instrumentation fails, you most likely need to open a support ticket and provide build debug logs. To provide those logs, you need to set the `DynatraceInstrumentationLogging` property and change the build log level to `Diagnostic`.

1. Set the `DynatraceInstrumentationLogging` property. Choose one of the following options to do that:

   * Create `Directory.Build.props` in the Android project directory:

   ```
   <Project>



   <PropertyGroup>



   <DynatraceInstrumentationLogging>true</DynatraceInstrumentationLogging>



   </PropertyGroup>



   </Project>
   ```

   * Add the `DynatraceInstrumentationLogging` property to the `.csproj` file of your project. Insert it into some existing `PropertyGroup`, depending on the configuration that you're executing.
2. Change the build output verbosity to `Diagnostic`. For details, see the Microsoft documentation on how to [change the amount of information included in the build logï»¿](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/how-to-view-save-and-configure-build-log-files?view=vs-2019#to-change-the-amount-of-information-included-in-the-build-log).
3. Rebuild your project.
4. Attach the build logs to the support ticket so that we can further analyze your issue.

# Instrument mobile apps with Dynatrace React Native plugin

# Instrument mobile apps with Dynatrace React Native plugin

* How-to guide
* 4-min read
* Updated on Nov 26, 2024

Our React Native plugin allows you to auto-instrument your React Native apps with Dynatrace OneAgent for Android and iOS. The plugin provides an API to add manual instrumentation and is compatible with raw, ejected React Native projects.

For detailed technical documentation, see the [Dynatrace React Native pluginï»¿](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dynatrace/react-native-plugin) page on the npm site.

Follow the steps below to set up the Dynatrace React Native plugin for your mobile app.

[![Step 1](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-1-086e22066c.svg "Step 1")

**Create a mobile application in Dynatrace**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/cross-platform-frameworks/react-native#create-app-in-ui "Auto-instrument your React Native applications with OneAgent.")[![Step 2](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-2-1a1384627e.svg "Step 2")

**Set up React Native plugin**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/cross-platform-frameworks/react-native#set-up-plugin "Auto-instrument your React Native applications with OneAgent.")[![Step 3](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-3-350cf6c19a.svg "Step 3")

**Build and run your app**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/cross-platform-frameworks/react-native#build-and-run-app "Auto-instrument your React Native applications with OneAgent.")

## Prerequisites

* React 16.8+
* React Native 0.60+
* Android version 5.0+ (API 21+)
* Gradle version 7.0+
* Android Gradle plugin version 7.0+
* Java 11
* iOS version 12+

## Step 1 Create a mobile application in Dynatrace

To create a mobile application in Dynatrace

1. In Dynatrace, go to **Mobile**.
2. Select **Create mobile app**.
3. Enter a name for your application and select **Create mobile app**. The application settings page opens.

## Step 2 Set up React Native plugin

1. From the application settings, select **Instrumentation wizard** > **React Native**. The instrumentation wizard guides you through the set-up process.
2. Install the Dynatrace React Native plugin:

   React Native 0.60.0+

   * Call `npm install @dynatrace/react-native-plugin`.
   * iOS only If you use pods, go to the `ios` directory and execute `pod install` to install the new Dynatrace dependency to your Xcode project.
3. Register the Dynatrace transformer: in the project's root, either create or extend `metro.config.js` so that it contains the `transformer.babelTransformerPath` property:

   ```
   module.exports = {



   transformer: {



   babelTransformerPath: require.resolve('@dynatrace/react-native-plugin/lib/dynatrace-transformer')



   },



   reporter: require("@dynatrace/react-native-plugin/lib/dynatrace-reporter")



   };
   ```
4. From the instrumentation wizard, download the `dynatrace.config.js` file and place it into the root directory of your project next to `app.json`. If you're upgrading from a previous version of the Dynatrace React Native plugin, copy the old configuration values from `dynatrace.config` to the new `dynatrace.config.js` file.
5. Update the Babel configuration in the `babel.config.js` file if you're using the following versions of Metro or Expo:

   * Metro 0.72.0+
   * Expo 44.0.0+ or babel-preset-expo 9.0.0+

   Metro

   Expo

   Using `metro-react-native-babel-preset`:

   ```
   module.exports = {



   presets: [



   ['module:metro-react-native-babel-preset'],



   ],



   plugins: [



   [



   '@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx',



   {



   runtime: 'automatic',



   importSource: "@dynatrace/react-native-plugin"



   },



   ],



   ],



   };
   ```

   Using `babel-preset-expo`:

   ```
   module.exports = {



   presets: [



   ['babel-preset-expo',



   {



   jsxRuntime: 'automatic',



   jsxImportSource: '@dynatrace/react-native-plugin',



   },



   ],



   ],



   };
   ```

## Step 3 Build and run your app

* Run `npx instrumentDynatrace` in the root of your React Native project to apply the configuration set in the `dynatrace.config.js` file. This command configures both Android and iOS projects.
* Execute `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios` to rebuild and run your app.

  If you're upgrading to React Native 0.70+ or using the @react-native-community/cli 9.x+ version, note that our automated script running before every `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios` command is no longer working. If you've changed the configuration in the `dynatrace.config.js` file, execute `npx instrumentDynatrace` to apply the new configuration.
* Whenever you change the configuration in the `dynatrace.config.js` file, run the following commands and then rebuild your app.

  1. `npx instrumentDynatrace` to apply the new configuration from `dynatrace.config.js`
  2. `react-native start --reset-cache` to reset the cache. Not resetting the cache might result in a mixture of old and new configurations.
* Specify custom paths via [custom argumentsï»¿](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dynatrace/react-native-plugin#customizing-paths-for-configuration).

## User action naming

See [User action naming rules](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-actions#user-action-naming-rules "Learn what user actions are and how they help you understand what users do with your application.") for more details on user action naming in Dynatrace.

#### React views

* `displayName`: Checks if React views have a display name set.
* `class name`: If the display name is unavailable, the class name is used by taking the name property from the constructor.

#### Touchables

* Accessibility label
* If both are not set, searches for inner text
* For an image button, searches for the source

#### Button Title

* Accessibility label
* For an image button, searches for the source
* If nothing is found, searches for inner text

If you minify the React Native code, you can use the `keep_classname` setting to preserve the class name.

# Instrument mobile apps with Dynatrace Xamarin NuGet package

# Instrument mobile apps with Dynatrace Xamarin NuGet package

* How-to guide
* 12-min read
* Updated on Apr 16, 2024

The Dynatrace Xamarin NuGet package helps auto-instrument your Xamarin app with OneAgent for Android and iOS as well as provides an API for [manual instrumentation](#usage-mobile-agent). The package is compatible with `Xamarin.iOS`, `Xamarin.Android`, and `Xamarin.Forms` projects.

Deprecation and end of support for Dynatrace Xamarin NuGet package

On May 1, 2024, [Microsoft will end support for all Xamarin SDKsï»¿](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/xamarin#microsoft-support). For this reason, we're deprecating the Dynatrace Xamarin NuGet package in May 2024. We will let you know in which upcoming package version we will be only fixing bugs and addressing important security issues.

Also, in accordance with the [Dynatrace Support Policyï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/company/trust-center/support-policy/), we will end support for the Dynatrace Xamarin NuGet package in May 2025.

We recommend that you [upgrade your Xamarin projects to .NETï»¿](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/maui/migration) and use the [Dynatrace .NET MAUI NuGet package](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/cross-platform-frameworks/maui "Monitor .NET MAUI applications with Dynatrace OneAgent.") instead of the deprecated Xamarin NuGet package.

## Supported features

#### Auto-instrumentation

* User actions
* Lifecycle events
* Web requests
* Crashes

#### Manual instrumentation

* Custom actions
* Web requests
* Values
* Events
* Errors
* Crashes
* User tagging

## Requirements

1. In Visual Studio, right-click the main project of your app and select **Manage NuGet packages**.
2. Find [**Dynatrace.OneAgent.Xamarin** from nuget.orgï»¿](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dynatrace.OneAgent.Xamarin) and select **Add Package**.
3. Select the checkboxes of all the projects to which you want to add the NuGet package.
4. Select **OK**.

### Step 2 Create an application and get the config file

Create a new mobile application in Dynatrace and download the configuration file.

1. In Dynatrace, go to **Mobile**.
2. Select **Create mobile app**.
3. Enter a name for your application and select **Create mobile app**. The application settings page opens.
4. From the application settings, select **Instrumentation wizard** > **Xamarin**.
5. Under step 2, select **Download dynatrace.config.json** to get the configuration file.

### Step 3 Add the config file to your project

Add the [`dynatrace.config.json` file](#config-file), which you downloaded in the previous step, to your project.

Android

iOS

Add the `dynatrace.config.json` file to the `Assets` directory of your Android project.

Add the `dynatrace.config.json` file to the `Resources` directory of your iOS project.

Before each build, our package automatically creates a new `Dynatrace.plist` file based on the options set in your configuration file.

### Step 4 Add the OneAgent start method

The start method is required for OneAgent to start.

Android

iOS

```
using Dynatrace.Xamarin;



Agent.Instance.Start();
```

```
using Dynatrace.Xamarin;



Agent.Instance.Start();
```

### Step 5 Set up Xamarin.Forms `DependencyService`

Xamarin.Forms only

This instruction is for Xamarin.Forms versions 4.7.0+, which use `RegisterSingleton`. For earlier Xamarin.Forms versions, see the [instruction below](#xamarin-forms-4-6).

Register the interface at startup in the native part of your Xamarin.Forms application, and paste the following code right after `Forms.Init()`.

The following example is for an Android Forms application:

```
using Dynatrace.Xamarin;



Xamarin.Essentials.Platform.Init(this, savedInstanceState);



global::Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init(this, savedInstanceState);



Xamarin.Forms.DependencyService.RegisterSingleton<IDynatrace>(Agent.Instance);



LoadApplication(new App());
```

The following code in your Xamarin.Forms application allows you to access OneAgent:

```
using Dynatrace.Xamarin;



IDynatrace dynatrace = DependencyService.Get<IDynatrace>();
```

In case of auto-instrumentation, you also need to apply the Dynatrace Xamarin NuGet package to the native parts of your application.

Xamarin.Forms 4.6.0 and earlier

If you can't use `DependencyService.RegisterSingleton` as your Xamarin.Forms version is 4.6.0 or earlier, there is a workaround. The following code snippet shows how this works for Xamarin.Forms and Android, but you can easily apply it to iOS as well.

The `App.xaml.cs` file in the Xamarin.Forms part:

```
public partial class App : Application



{



static readonly Dictionary<Type, Func<object, object>> factories = new Dictionary<Type, Func<object, object>>();



public App()



{



InitializeComponent();



DependencyResolver.ResolveUsing((type, args) => factories.ContainsKey(type) ? factories[type].Invoke(args) : null);



IDynatrace Dynatrace = DependencyService.Resolve<IDynatrace>();



Dynatrace.Start(null);



}



public static void Register(Type type, Func<object, object> factory)



{



factories[type] = factory;



}



...



}
```

The Android part, where you have to call `RegisterSingleton`, should look like this:

```
public class MainActivity : global::Xamarin.Forms.Platform.Android.FormsAppCompatActivity



{



protected override void OnCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)



{



...



Xamarin.Essentials.Platform.Init(this, savedInstanceState);



global::Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init(this, savedInstanceState);



App.Register(typeof(IDynatrace), (o) => Agent.Instance);



LoadApplication(new App());



}



...



}
```

### Step 6 optional Enable automatic web request instrumentation Optional

You can optionally use the following method to enable the auto-instrumentation of web requests. The `HttpMessageHandler` used by `HttpClient` takes care of the manual web request instrumentation.

```
using Dynatrace.Xamarin;



var httpHandler = Agent.Instance.GetHttpMessageHandler();



var httpClient = new HttpClient(httpHandler);
```

Moreover, you can also have your own HTTP handler:

```
using Dynatrace.Xamarin;



var defaultHttpHandler = new HttpClientHandler();



var httpHandler = Agent.Instance.GetHttpMessageHandler(defaultHttpHandler);



var httpClient = new HttpClient(httpHandler);
```

## Manual instrumentation

The sections below describe how to start OneAgent manually, create custom actions, instrument web requests, and report values, events, and crashes.

### Start OneAgent

You can use the manual startup with a configuration builder (Android) or a configuration dictionary (iOS).

1. Modify the [`dynatrace.config.json` file](#config-file) to disable OneAgent autostart.

   Android

   iOS

   ```
   {



   "android": {



   "autoStart": {



   "enabled": false



   }



   }



   }
   ```

   ```
   {



   "ios": {



   "DTXAutoStart": false



   }



   }
   ```

   Don't add additional properties to the configuration file. If you do that, the build fails with an exception.
2. Start OneAgent manually and pass the required properties.

   Android

   iOS

   ```
   using Dynatrace.Xamarin;



   Agent.Instance.Start(new ConfigurationBuilder("<insertBeaconURL>","<insertApplicationID>") .BuildConfiguration());
   ```

   ```
   using Dynatrace.Xamarin;



   var configDict = new Dictionary<string, object>();



   configDict.Add("DTXApplicationID", "<insertApplicationID>");



   configDict.Add("DTXBeaconURL", "<insertBeaconURL");



   Agent.Instance.Start(configDict);
   ```

### Create custom actions

You can create custom actions and enhance them with additional information such as values, events, and errors.

Call `EnterAction` to start a custom action and `LeaveAction` to close a custom action. Timing is measured automatically.

```
using Dynatrace.Xamarin;



var myAction = Agent.Instance.EnterAction("Tap on Confirm");



//Perform the action and whatever else is needed.



myAction.LeaveAction();
```

For a mobile custom action or a mobile autogenerated user action, the maximum name length is 250 characters.

Check the following links for information on user action naming: [Android](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/monitoring-capabilities#user-action-naming "Configure the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin to adjust the monitoring capabilities of OneAgent.") and [iOS](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/oneagent-sdk-for-ios#user-action-naming "Enrich mobile user experience monitoring using OneAgent SDK for iOS.").

When the [user opt-in mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile#opt-in-mode-mobile "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.") is enabled for your application, it might affect user tagging and reporting of custom events, user actions, values, and errors. The exact data types not reported to Dynatrace depend on the data collection level set by a particular user. For details, refer to [Data collection levels](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile#data-collection-levels "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.").

### Create child actions

Besides generating standalone custom actions, you can also create [child actions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-actions#child-actions "Learn what user actions are and how they help you understand what users do with your application.").

Child actions are similar to parent custom actions. When a parent action is closed, all child actions of the parent action are automatically closed.

```
using Dynatrace.Xamarin;



var myAction = Agent.Instance.EnterAction("Tap on Confirm");



var mySubAction = myAction.EnterAction("Tap on Confirm again");



//Perform the action and whatever else is needed.



mySubAction.LeaveAction();



myAction.LeaveAction();
```

For a mobile custom action or a mobile autogenerated user action, the maximum name length is 250 characters.

There's no limit on the number of child actions attached to a custom action. However, note that you can have only one level of child actionsâyou can't create a child action for another child action (child actions can't have their own child actions). Also, refer to [User session structure for individual user](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-session#session-structure-dep-on-app-type "Learn how a user session is defined, when a user session starts or ends, how user session duration is calculated, and more.").

Child actions are not displayed on the [user session details page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/new-user-sessions#session-details-page "Learn about user session segmentation and filtering attributes."), but you can view them on the [waterfall analysis page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/waterfall-analysis "Learn how to analyze all user action monitoring data through waterfall analysis.") for a custom action to which these child actions are attached.

### Cancel custom actions

If you need to cancel an already created but not yet closed custom action, call `Cancel`. Canceling an action discards all data associated with it: all reported values, events, and errors are discarded; all child actions are canceled.

```
using Dynatrace.Xamarin;



var myAction = Agent.Instance.EnterAction("Tap on Confirm");



// Action is canceled



myAction.Cancel();
```

You can't cancel a closed action, so calling `Cancel` after `LeaveAction` is impossible for the same action. The same goes for closing a canceled action: you can't call `LeaveAction` after using `Cancel` for the same action.

### Instrument web requests

Use the following code snippet to instrument web requests:

```
using Dynatrace.Xamarin;



// Create an action



var webAction = Agent.Instance.EnterAction(actionName: "WebRequest Action");



// Generate a new unique tag associated with the web request action



string requestTag = webAction.GetRequestTag(url);



string requestTagHeader = webAction.GetRequestTagHeader();



// Place the Dynatrace HTTP header on your web request



httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add(requestTagHeader, requestTag);



// Generate a WebRequestTiming object based on the unique tag



WebRequestTiming timing = (WebRequestTiming)Agent.Instance.GetWebRequestTiming(requestTag, url);



// Start web request timing before the HTTP request is sent



timing.StartWebRequestTiming();



try



{



var response = await httpClient.GetAsync(url);



// Stop web request timing when the HTTP response is received and the response body is obtained



timing.StopWebRequestTiming(url, (int)response.StatusCode, response.ReasonPhrase);



}



catch (HttpRequestException exception)



{



// Stop web request timing when a connection exception occurs



timing.StopWebRequestTiming(url, -1, exception.ToString());



}



finally



{



// Leave an action



webAction.LeaveAction();



}
```

### Report a value

The `reportValue` method allows you to report key-value pairs of metadata that you can later view in the Dynatrace web UI and convert into [user action and user session properties](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/analyze-and-use/action-and-session-properties-mobile "User action and session properties, which are metadata key-value pairs, provide added visibility and deeper analysis of your end users' experience. Using these properties for your applications, you can filter user sessions, add calculated metrics, create charts, and more."). The reported values must be part of a user action.

You can report values of the following data types:

* `int`
* `double`
* `string`

```
ReportValue(valueName: string, value: int);



ReportValue(valueName: string, value: double);



ReportValue(valueName: string, value: string);
```

For instance, to report a `string` value within the `Tap on Confirm` action, use the following code:

```
using Dynatrace.Xamarin;



var myAction = Agent.Instance.EnterAction("Tap on Confirm");



myAction.ReportValue("Customer type", "Gold");



myAction.LeaveAction();
```

To view the reported values in the Dynatrace web UI, go to the details of the user action that should contain that metadata and scroll down to the **Reported values** section.

![User action details page with SDK-reported values](https://dt-cdn.net/images/user-action-details-with-reported-values-2048-b44e8bca3e.png)

To add action and session properties based on the reported values and then use these properties to create powerful queries, segmentations, and aggregations, see [Define user action and user session properties for mobile applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/define-mobile-action-and-session-properties "Send metadata to Dynatrace and define action and session properties for your monitored mobile applications.").

When the [user opt-in mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile#opt-in-mode-mobile "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.") is enabled for your application, it might affect user tagging and reporting of custom events, user actions, values, and errors. The exact data types not reported to Dynatrace depend on the data collection level set by a particular user. For details, refer to [Data collection levels](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile#data-collection-levels "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.").

### Report an event

For any open action, you can report an event. Use the following API call:

```
ReportEvent(eventName: string);
```

If you want to report standalone events with lots of additional information, see [Report a business event](#report-business-event).

When the [user opt-in mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile#opt-in-mode-mobile "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.") is enabled for your application, it might affect user tagging and reporting of custom events, user actions, values, and errors. The exact data types not reported to Dynatrace depend on the data collection level set by a particular user. For details, refer to [Data collection levels](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile#data-collection-levels "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.").

### Report an error

To report an [error](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#error "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace."), use the `ReportError` method.

```
ReportError(errorName: string, errorCode: number);
```

When the [user opt-in mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile#opt-in-mode-mobile "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.") is enabled for your application, it might affect user tagging and reporting of custom events, user actions, values, and errors. The exact data types not reported to Dynatrace depend on the data collection level set by a particular user. For details, refer to [Data collection levels](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile#data-collection-levels "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.").

### Report an error stack trace

To report an error stack trace, use the following API call:

```
using Dynatrace.Xamarin;



Agent.Instance.ReportErrorStacktrace("Error_Class", "Error_Value", "Error_Reason", "Error_Stacktrace");
```

### Report a crash

To report a [crash](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#crash "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace."), use the following API call.

```
using Dynatrace.Xamarin;



Agent.Instance.ReportCrash("CrashWithoutException", "Crash_Reason", "Crash_Stacktrace");
```

You can also use an exception object:

```
using Dynatrace.Xamarin;



Agent.Instance.ReportCrashWithException("CrashWithExceptionObj", exception);
```

The time when the crash details are sent to Dynatrace depends on your mobile application operating system.

* **Android**

  In general, the crash details are sent immediately after the crash, so the user doesnât have to relaunch the application. However, in some cases, the application should be reopened within 10 minutes so that the crash report is sent. Note that Dynatrace doesn't send crash reports that are older than 10 minutes (as such reports can no longer be correlated on the Dynatrace Cluster).
* **iOS**

  The crash details are sent only when the user reopens the mobile application (so on the next application launch). However, if the user doesn't open the application within 10 minutes, the crash report is deleted. This is because Dynatrace doesn't send crash reports that are older than 10 minutes (as such reports can no longer be correlated on the Dynatrace Cluster).

Reporting a crash forces a user session to be completed. Any subsequent actions are included in a new user session.

Android only When you use automated crash reporting, Visual Studio might catch the exception before OneAgent. If you notice that Dynatrace doesn't report crashes to your environment, make sure that [you're not using the debug option in Visual Studio](#debugger-turn-off). Otherwise, the debugger catches the crash and nothing is reported to your Dynatrace environment.

### Report a business event

Dynatrace SaaS version 1.253+

With `sendBizEvent`, you can report business events. These are standalone events, as Dynatrace sends them separately from user actions or user sessions.

Business events are only captured for monitored sessions. When OneAgent is disabled either through a special flag or due to [cost and traffic control](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-cost-and-traffic-control-mobile "Leverage the cost and traffic control setting in Dynatrace to reduce session usage for mobile apps."), business events are not reported for such sessions. Note that this behavior might be subject to change in the future, potentially allowing business events to be sent to Dynatrace regardless of session monitoring.

For additional details on business events, refer to [Business Observability](/docs/observe/business-observability "Basic concepts, setup and configuration, and use cases for Dynatrace Business Observability").

```
using Dynatrace.Xamarin;



var attributes = new Dictionary<string, JsonValue>();



attributes.Add("event.name", "Confirmed Booking");



attributes.Add("screen", "booking-confirmation");



attributes.Add("product", "Danube Anna Hotel");



attributes.Add("amount", 358.35);



attributes.Add("currency", "USD");



attributes.Add("reviewScore", 4.8);



attributes.Add("arrivalDate", "2022-11-05");



attributes.Add("departureDate", "2022-11-15");



attributes.Add("journeyDuration", 10);



attributes.Add("adultTravelers", 2);



attributes.Add("childrenTravelers", 0);



Agent.Instance.SendBizEvent("com.easytravel.funnel.booking-finished", attributes);
```

### Tag specific users

You can tag each user of your application with a unique user name. This enables you to search and filter specific user sessions and analyze individual user behavior over time. For more details, see [User tagging](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#user-tagging "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace.").

Make the following API call to tag the current session with a particular name:

```
using Dynatrace.Xamarin;



Agent.Instance.IdentifyUser("John Smith");
```

OneAgent for Android version 237+ OneAgent for iOS version 235+ Sessions split due to idle or duration timeout are re-tagged automatically.

When OneAgent ends a tagged session because the session duration has reached its set limit or due to the user's inactivity, the subsequent session is re-tagged automatically. You don't need to provide the user identification information again.

However, note that OneAgent does not re-tag the subsequent session in the following cases:

* When you explicitly end a tagged user session via [`endVisit`](#end-session)
* When the user or the mobile operating system closes or force stops the app
* When OneAgent ends the current user session and generates a new session after the privacy settings have been changed

See [User sessions > Session end](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-session#user-session-end--mobile-apps "Learn how a user session is defined, when a user session starts or ends, how user session duration is calculated, and more.") to learn when OneAgent ends a mobile user session.

When the [user opt-in mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile#opt-in-mode-mobile "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.") is enabled for your application, it might affect user tagging and reporting of custom events, user actions, values, and errors. The exact data types not reported to Dynatrace depend on the data collection level set by a particular user. For details, refer to [Data collection levels](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile#data-collection-levels "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.").

### End a session

You can force a session to end via the API call. This also closes all open actions and starts a new session.

```
using Dynatrace.Xamarin;



Agent.Instance.EndVisit();
```

### Configure data privacy (opt-in mode)

With user opt-in mode, each user of your application can set their data privacy preferences and decide whether they want or don't want to share their information. When the opt-in mode is enabled, you need to ask each user for permission to capture their data; then, you store their data privacy preferences. For details, see [User opt-in mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile#opt-in-mode-mobile "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.").

#### Enable user opt-in mode

To activate the user opt-in mode, set the `userOptIn` property (Android) or [`DTXUserOptIn` configuration key](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys#privacy-and-security "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.") (iOS) to `true` in the [`dynatrace.config.json` file](#config-file).

#### Retrieve user's data privacy preferences

You can retrieve the data privacy preferences of a particular user.

To get the current `UserPrivacyOptions` configuration, use the following API call:

```
using Dynatrace.Xamarin;



// Get the UserPrivacyOptions object



UserPrivacyOptions currentOptions = Agent.Instance.GetUserPrivacyOptions();



// Get the individual settings for DataCollectionLevel and crash reporting



bool crashOptedIn = Agent.Instance.GetUserPrivacyOptions().CrashReportingOptedIn;



DataCollectionLevel dataCollectionLevel = Agent.Instance.GetUserPrivacyOptions().DataCollectionLevel;
```

#### Change user's data privacy preferences

You can adjust the data privacy preferences based on the decision of a particular user.

To set new options on a `UserPrivacyOptions` object, use the following code:

```
using Dynatrace.Xamarin;



// Creating a new UserPrivacyOptions object requires setting the two parameters of DataCollectionLevel and crash reporting



UserPrivacyOptions options = new UserPrivacyOptions(DataCollectionLevel.Performance, false);



// Update the options with the setter



// Set a data collection level (user allowed you to capture performance and personal data)



options.DataCollectionLevel = DataCollectionLevel.UserBehavior;



// Allow crash reporting (user allowed you to collect information on crashes)



options.CrashReportingOptedIn = true;



// Get the values of the configuration with the getter



options.DataCollectionLevel;



options.CrashReportingOptedIn;



// Get the UserPrivacyOptions object



UserPrivacyOptions currentOptions = Agent.Instance.GetUserPrivacyOptions();
```

To apply the new `UserPrivacyOptions` configuration, use this code:

```
using Dynatrace.Xamarin;



UserPrivacyOptions options = new UserPrivacyOptions(DataCollectionLevel.UserBehavior, true);



Agent.Instance.ApplyUserPrivacyOptions(options);
```

The possible values for the [data collection level](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile#data-collection-levels "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.") are as follows:

* `Off`
* `Performance`
* `UserBehavior`

### Report GPS location

You can report the latitude and longitude.

```
SetGPSLocation(latitude: double, longitude: double);
```

## Configuration file

The `dynatrace.config.json` configuration file contains your application ID, beacon URL, and some other settings.

* You can [download this file from Dynatrace](#installation-dynatrace) or create it manually.
* If you don't add a configuration file with at least the beacon URL and the application ID properties, the build fails. Alternatively, use the [manual startup](#start-agent) with a configuration builder (Android) or a configuration dictionary (iOS).
* When you use a specific build configurationâfor example, `Debug`, `Release`, or a custom-defined configurationâour package searches the `Assets` (Android) or `Resources` (iOS) directory for a configuration file named `dynatrace<Configuration>.config.json`. For example, if you're using the `Debug` build configuration, our package looks for a file named `dynatraceDebug.config.json`.
* If you want to specify a custom path for your configuration, set it via the `DynatraceConfigurationFile` property.

  Create `Directory.Build.props` in the Android/iOS (or general) project directory:

  ```
  <Project>



  <PropertyGroup>



  <DynatraceConfigurationFile>CUSTOM_PATH/dynatrace.config.json</DynatraceConfigurationFile>



  </PropertyGroup>



  </Project>
  ```

In summary, this results in the following order in which the configuration will be used:

1. Custom configuration path through `DynatraceConfigurationFile` property
2. Configuration-specific file like `dynatrace<Configuration>.config.json`
3. Default name `dynatrace.config.json`

The following is the `dynatrace.config.json` file structure for Android and iOS.

Android

iOS

```
{



"android": {



"autoStart": {



"applicationId": "<insertApplicationID>",



"beaconUrl": "<insertBeaconURL>"



},



"userOptIn": true,



"agentBehavior": {



"startupLoadBalancing": true



}



}



}
```

```
{



"ios": {



"DTXApplicationId": "<insertApplicationID>",



"DTXBeaconUrl": "<insertBeaconURL>",



"DTXUserOptIn": true,



"DTXStartupLoadBalancing": true



}



}
```

Never use dot notation for the configuration file. Always write in full bracket style.

## Enable OneAgent debug logs

If the instrumentation runs through and your application starts, but you see no data in your Dynatrace environment, you probably need to dig deeper to find out why OneAgents aren't sending any data. Opening up a support ticket is a great idea but gathering logs first is even better.

Android

iOS

Update your [`dynatrace.config.json` file](#config-file) to enable OneAgent debug logs.

```
{



"android": {



"autoStart": {



"applicationId": "<insertApplicationID>",



"beaconUrl": "<insertBeaconURL>"



},



"userOptIn": true,



"debug": {



"agentLogging": true



}



}



}
```

Add the following configuration snippet to the [`dynatrace.config.json` file](#config-file):

```
{



"ios": {



"DTXApplicationId": "<insertApplicationID>",



"DTXBeaconUrl": "<insertBeaconURL>",



"DTXUserOptIn": true,



"DTXLogLevel": "ALL"



}



}
```

## Enable build debug logs for Android

Android only

If the Android instrumentation fails, you most likely need to open a support ticket and provide build debug logs. To provide those logs, you need to set the `DynatraceInstrumentationLogging` property and change the build log level to `Diagnostic`.

1. Set the `DynatraceInstrumentationLogging` property. Choose one of the following options to do that:

   * Create `Directory.Build.props` in the Android project directory:

   ```
   <Project>



   <PropertyGroup>



   <DynatraceInstrumentationLogging>true</DynatraceInstrumentationLogging>



   </PropertyGroup>



   </Project>
   ```

   * Add the `DynatraceInstrumentationLogging` property to the `.csproj` file of your project. Insert it into some existing `PropertyGroup`, depending on the configuration that you're executing.
2. Change the build output verbosity to `Diagnostic`. For details, see the Microsoft documentation on how to [change the amount of information included in the build logï»¿](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/how-to-view-save-and-configure-build-log-files?view=vs-2019#to-change-the-amount-of-information-included-in-the-build-log).
3. Rebuild your project.
4. Attach the build logs to the support ticket so that we can further analyze your issue.

## Troubleshooting

If you can't resolve a problem, check [Mobile applications: Issues with Dynatrace Xamarin NuGet packageï»¿](https://dt-url.net/xn638zc) in the Dynatrace Community.

# Get started with Android monitoring

# Get started with Android monitoring

* How-to guide
* 2-min read
* Updated on Sep 06, 2023

To monitor your Android app, you first need to create a mobile application in Dynatrace and then instrument your actual Android app.

[![Step 1](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-1-086e22066c.svg "Step 1")

**Create a mobile application in Dynatrace**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/get-started-with-android-monitoring#create-app-ui "Learn the steps you need to perform to instrument your Android app for monitoring with Dynatrace.")[![Step 2](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-2-1a1384627e.svg "Step 2")

**Instrument your Android app**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/get-started-with-android-monitoring#instrument-app "Learn the steps you need to perform to instrument your Android app for monitoring with Dynatrace.")[![Step 3](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-3-350cf6c19a.svg "Step 3")

**Fine-tune the instrumentation**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/get-started-with-android-monitoring#adjust-instrumentation "Learn the steps you need to perform to instrument your Android app for monitoring with Dynatrace.")

## Step 1 Create a mobile application in Dynatrace

Before instrumenting your actual Android app, create a [mobile application](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/applications#mobile "Learn about monitored applications in Real User Monitoring and the different application types supported by Dynatrace.") in Dynatrace. You will use this application to monitor and analyze your Android app.

To create a mobile application in Dynatrace

1. In Dynatrace, go to **Mobile**.
2. Select **Create mobile app**.
3. Enter a name for your application and select **Create mobile app**. The application settings page opens.

## Step 2 Instrument your Android app

When you have a mobile application in Dynatrace, instrument your actual Android app with the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin or OneAgent SDK for Android.

[### Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin

To auto-instrument your Android project, use the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin. It integrates the auto-instrumentation process into your Android build.](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin "Learn how the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin can auto-instrument your Android application project.")[### OneAgent SDK for Android

If you can't use our plugin due to technical limitations, try standalone manual instrumentation with OneAgent SDK.](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-oneagent-sdk/manual-instrumentation "Use OneAgent SDK for Android to manually instrument your Android application.")

## Step 3 Fine-tune the instrumentation

After you've instrumented your Android app, you might want to configure some additional settings:

* [Adjust communication with OneAgent SDK for Android](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-oneagent-sdk/adjust-oneagent-communication "Configure communication with OneAgent to report the user experience data to Dynatrace.")
* [Configure the auto-instrumentation process](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/monitoring-capabilities "Configure the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin to adjust the monitoring capabilities of OneAgent.")
* Create custom actions, report errors, tag specific users, and more using [OneAgent SDK for Android](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-oneagent-sdk/oneagent-sdk-for-android "Learn how to enrich mobile user experience monitoring in Android using OneAgent SDK.")
* Enable and configure [Session Replay on crashes](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-replay/session-replay-android "Set up Session Replay for your Android apps to learn which actions your users perform.")
* [Configure the data privacy settings](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.")
* Learn what [data Dynatrace captures for your Android app](/docs/manage/data-privacy-and-security/data-privacy/user-privacy-for-android "Information on types of data that OneAgent for Android collects. You can use this page when filling out the Data safety form in Google Play Console.") to complete or update the Data safety form in Google Play Console

## Access mobile instrumentation wizard

The mobile instrumentation wizard in Dynatrace provides you with get-started instructions on instrumenting your mobile applications. The wizard also contains code snippets with your application identification keys that you'll need to add to your project's build file. The application identification keysâ`applicationId` and `beaconUrl`âare required so that your application can send monitoring data to Dynatrace.

1. Go to **Mobile**.
2. Select the mobile application that you want to configure.
3. Select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit** in the upper-right corner of the tile with your application name.
4. From the application settings, select **Instrumentation wizard**.
5. Select **Android**.

# Manually instrument your application using OneAgent SDK for Android

# Manually instrument your application using OneAgent SDK for Android

* How-to guide
* 2-min read
* Updated on Jan 10, 2024

When you can't use the [Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin "Learn how the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin can auto-instrument your Android application project.") due to certain technical limitations, opt for standalone manual instrumentation with OneAgent SDK for Android.

Follow the steps below to manually instrument your application using OneAgent SDK for Android.

[![Step 1](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-1-086e22066c.svg "Step 1")

**Ensure that the Maven Central repository is declared.**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-oneagent-sdk/manual-instrumentation#step-declare-maven-central "Use OneAgent SDK for Android to manually instrument your Android application.")[![Step 2](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-2-1a1384627e.svg "Step 2")

**Include the OneAgent library as a dependency to your project.**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-oneagent-sdk/manual-instrumentation#step-include-OneAgent-library "Use OneAgent SDK for Android to manually instrument your Android application.")[![Step 3](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-3-350cf6c19a.svg "Step 3")

**Start OneAgent manually.**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-oneagent-sdk/manual-instrumentation#step-start-one-agent "Use OneAgent SDK for Android to manually instrument your Android application.")[![Step 4](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-4-3f89d67d41.svg "Step 4")

**Capture additional data via OneAgent SDK for Android.**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-oneagent-sdk/manual-instrumentation#step-capture-additional-data "Use OneAgent SDK for Android to manually instrument your Android application.")

When you use standalone manual instrumentation, nothing is done automatically. Ensure that every important part of your application is manually instrumented. Otherwise, OneAgent won't be able to monitor your application and send monitoring data to Dynatrace.

1. Ensure that the Maven Central repository is declared.

   OneAgent for Android is hosted on [Maven Centralï»¿](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.dynatrace.agent/agent-android). In the Gradle settings file, verify that `mavenCentral()` is added to the `repositories` blocks under `dependencyResolutionManagement`. Check the [official Android documentationï»¿](https://dt-url.net/gradle-settings-file) to see what the Gradle settings file should look like.

   Projects with previous Android template: Ensure that the Maven Central repository is declared.

   You might need to add `mavenCentral()` to all `repositories` blocks in the [top-level build fileï»¿](https://dt-url.net/top-level-build-file).
2. Include the OneAgent library as a dependency to your project.

   When you use Gradle as a build automation tool, add the OneAgent library as an `implementation` or `api` dependency in one or more modules. The integration depends on the parts that you want to instrument and the project architecture that you use for your Android project.

   Use version `8.+` so that Gradle can automatically update the OneAgent library when a new minor version is available. When Dynatrace releases a new major version, manually upgrade to the new versionâthe new major version might contain breaking changes, so manual adjustments are usually required.

   **Single-module Android project**

   Add the OneAgent library as an `implementation` dependency in your Android application module.

   Groovy

   Kotlin

   ```
   dependencies {



   implementation 'com.dynatrace.agent:agent-android:8.+'



   }
   ```

   ```
   dependencies {



   implementation("com.dynatrace.agent:agent-android:8.+")



   }
   ```

   **Multi-module Android projects with feature modules**

   Add the OneAgent library as an `api` dependency in your base module (Android application module). If you use internal Android library modules that need to be instrumented, add the OneAgent library as an `implementation` dependency to these internal Android library modules.
3. Start OneAgent manually.

   Use the [`Dynatrace.startup(Application, Configuration)`ï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/doc/javadoc/oneagent/android/agent/com/dynatrace/android/agent/Dynatrace.html#startup(android.app.Application,com.dynatrace.android.agent.conf.Configuration)) API method, and start OneAgent manually in the [`Application.onCreate`ï»¿](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Application#onCreate()) method.

   Java

   Kotlin

   ```
   public class YourApplication extends Application {



   @Override



   public void onCreate() {



   super.onCreate();



   // provide the application context as parameter



   Dynatrace.startup(this, new DynatraceConfigurationBuilder("<YourApplicationID>", "<ProvidedBeaconUrl>")



   ... // additional configuration



   .buildConfiguration());



   }



   }
   ```

   ```
   class YourApplication : Application() {



   override fun onCreate() {



   super.onCreate()



   // provide the application context as parameter



   Dynatrace.startup(this, DynatraceConfigurationBuilder("<YourApplicationID>", "<ProvidedBeaconUrl>")



   ... // additional configuration



   .buildConfiguration())



   }



   }
   ```

   If you need to start OneAgent at a later stage, use the [`Dynatrace.startup(Activity, Configuration)`ï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/doc/javadoc/oneagent/android/agent/com/dynatrace/android/agent/Dynatrace.html#startup(android.app.Activity,com.dynatrace.android.agent.conf.Configuration)) API method. Provide an active `Activity` as a parameter so that OneAgent can immediately monitor it.

   Java

   Kotlin

   ```
   Dynatrace.startup(yourActiveActivity, new DynatraceConfigurationBuilder("<YourApplicationID>", "<ProvidedBeaconUrl>")



   ... // additional configuration



   .buildConfiguration());
   ```

   ```
   Dynatrace.startup(yourActiveActivity, DynatraceConfigurationBuilder("<YourApplicationID>", "<ProvidedBeaconUrl>")



   ... // additional configuration



   .buildConfiguration())
   ```

   To get the correct application identification keys (`applicationId` and `beaconUrl`), access the [mobile instrumentation wizard](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/get-started-with-android-monitoring#instrumentation-wizard "Learn the steps you need to perform to instrument your Android app for monitoring with Dynatrace.") for your application.

   If your application supports Direct Boot, never call the `Dynatrace.startup` API method from a Direct Boot aware component. Also, check [Adjust communication with OneAgent SDK for Android](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-oneagent-sdk/adjust-oneagent-communication "Configure communication with OneAgent to report the user experience data to Dynatrace.") to make sure that OneAgent can transmit data to Dynatrace.
4. Capture additional data via [OneAgent SDK for Android](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-oneagent-sdk/oneagent-sdk-for-android "Learn how to enrich mobile user experience monitoring in Android using OneAgent SDK.").

   For instance, you can create custom actions, report errors, tag specific users, and more.

# Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin

# Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin

* Overview
* 6-min read
* Updated on Jan 21, 2026

You can use the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin only for Android projects that use the [Android Gradle pluginï»¿](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/index.html) to build the app. You should apply the Dynatrace Android Gradle to the [top-level build fileï»¿](https://dt-url.net/top-level-build-file) (either `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`), which is located in the root project directory. This approach allows the plugin to properly configure the Android subprojects and establish the auto-instrumentation process as part of the Android build process.

The Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin is hosted on [Maven Centralï»¿](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.dynatrace.tools.android/gradle-plugin/overview), and the technical documentation is available as [DSL referenceï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/doc/javadoc/oneagent/android/gradle-plugin/dsl/).

In a couple of months, we'll stop setting cookies to file scheme domains for hybrid applications. See [Disable cookies for file domains](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/adjust-oneagent-configuration#file-domain-cookies "Learn how to configure the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin to modify the OneAgent SDK configuration.") for more details and action items.

[Jetpack Compose auto-instrumentation](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/monitoring-capabilities#compose-instrumentation "Configure the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin to adjust the monitoring capabilities of OneAgent.") is enabled by default starting with Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin version 8.271.

## Requirements

* Gradle version 7.0.2+
* Android Gradle plugin version 7.0+
* JVM: Java 11+

## Instrumentation

The Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin uses bytecode instrumentation to instrument your app. It can instrument the source files of all subprojects and third-party libraries. Performance-wise, bytecode instrumentation is quick and has a low impact on the build time. By providing support for incremental builds and the build cache, the instrumentation of apps will be almost unnoticed.

### Instrumentation-specific capabilities

* Java and Kotlin: The Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin supports the instrumentation of Java and Kotlin classes. It also supports other JVM languages.
* Obfuscations and optimization: The auto-instrumentation process is completed before the [R8ï»¿](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/11/r8-new-code-shrinker-from-google-is.html) Gradle task. If you use another tool for obfuscation, you must ensure that the obfuscation task is executed after the auto-instrumentation process.

  OneAgent for Android and its transitive dependencies provide ProGuard rules that are designed for R8. If you use third-party obfuscation tools, you are responsible for ensuring that these tools are configured to honor the required keep rules. Failure to do so may result in runtime errors due to incorrectly obfuscated classes.

  If you use Android Gradle Plugin features such as [`ignoreFrom`ï»¿](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/11/configure-and-troubleshoot-r8-keep-rules.html) to filter out keep rules from dependencies, be aware that this may affect OneAgent functionality.
* Security and APK-hardening tools: Bytecode instrumentation happens before obfuscation and before [Android Dexer (D8)ï»¿](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/d8) transforms the `.class` bytecode into `.dex` bytecode that can be executed in the Android Runtime. Therefore, the plugin can ensure maximum compatibility with other security-focused and APK-hardening tools that calculate checksums for the DEX code, such as DexGuard and Arxan.

### Instrumentation-specific limitations

The Android Gradle plugin only instruments the `AndroidManifest.xml` and other `.class` files. It doesnât instrument the following components:

* Native code, such as code written with the [NDKï»¿](https://developer.android.com/ndk)
* Web components, such as `.html` and `.js` files
* Resource files, such as layout `.xml` files

### Compatibility with other monitoring tools

There might be compatibility issues with other performance monitoring plugins, especially when these plugins instrument OneAgent for Android. We recommend either using only one performance monitoring plugin or verifying via manual testing that the plugins you've chosen are compatible.

## Build

### Build-specific capabilities

The Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin supports Gradle build-specific capabilities, including the following:

* Faster incremental builds by modifying only classes and libraries, thereby reducing instrumentation time.
* [Build cacheï»¿](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_cache.html) to reduce build time by reusing outputs produced by other builds.
* Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin version 8.257+ [Configuration cacheï»¿](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/configuration_cache.html) to reduce build time by reusing the cached result of the configuration phase.
* [Apply Changesï»¿](https://developer.android.com/studio/run#apply-changes) for pushing code and resource changes to a running app without having to restart it. The app must be restarted only when the configuration of the plugin or OneAgent is changed.
* Build processes for [Android App Bundlesï»¿](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle) and APKs.
* [Multiple APK buildsï»¿](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/configure-apk-splits#build-apks) via the `splits` block so that the instrumentation step is executed only once.
* Support for [Kotlin DSLï»¿](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) in `build.gradle.kts` files.

### Build-specific limitations

* **Android library projects**: The Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin auto-instruments only Android application projects. It doesn't support the auto-instrumentation of stand-alone Android library projects. Our plugin auto-instruments the internal libraries if you add them as a dependency to your Android application project.
* **Android Gradle plugin `excludes` property**: With the [`excludes`ï»¿](https://developer.android.com/reference/tools/gradle-api/7.4/com/android/build/api/variant/Instrumentation#excludes()) property of the Android Gradle plugin, you can disable instrumentation for specific classes. This property is similar to the [`exclude`](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/configure-plugin-for-instrumentation#exclude-classes-and-methods "Learn how to configure the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin to adjust the auto-instrumentation process.") property of the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin. However, when you use the Dynatrace property, our plugin still instruments some very important classes to ensure that instrumentation is always valid. With the Android `excludes` property, all the specified classes aren't instrumented, which might negatively affect the instrumentation.

## Configuration

The Android Gradle plugin provides a wide range of configuration options to customize your Android application build and the monitored mobile user experience data.

The Gradle snippet from the **Instrumentation** page and the Gradle snippets from the documentation contain sample names for variant-specific configuration, such as `sampleConfig`. To understand this better, see how [variant-specific configurations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/configure-plugin-for-instrumentation#variant-specific-configs "Learn how to configure the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin to adjust the auto-instrumentation process.") are used.

### Configure monitoring capabilities

The following options can be used to customize OneAgent SDK for Android monitoring capabilities and fine-tune the auto-instrumentation process.

* [User action monitoring](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/monitoring-capabilities#user-action-monitoring "Configure the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin to adjust the monitoring capabilities of OneAgent.")
* [User action monitoring for Jetpack Compose](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/monitoring-capabilities#compose-instrumentation "Configure the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin to adjust the monitoring capabilities of OneAgent.")
* [Web request monitoring](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/monitoring-capabilities#web-request-monitoring "Configure the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin to adjust the monitoring capabilities of OneAgent.")
* [Lifecycle monitoring](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/monitoring-capabilities#lifecycle-monitoring "Configure the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin to adjust the monitoring capabilities of OneAgent.")
* [Crash reporting](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/monitoring-capabilities#crash-reporting "Configure the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin to adjust the monitoring capabilities of OneAgent.")
* [Rage tap detection](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/monitoring-capabilities#rage-tap-detection "Configure the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin to adjust the monitoring capabilities of OneAgent.")
* [Location monitoring](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/monitoring-capabilities#location-monitoring "Configure the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin to adjust the monitoring capabilities of OneAgent.")

### Configure instrumentation processes

The plugin also provides additional configuration options to customize the instrumentation process:

* [Variant-specific configurations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/configure-plugin-for-instrumentation#variant-specific-configs "Learn how to configure the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin to adjust the auto-instrumentation process.")
* [Auto-instrumentation deactivation](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/configure-plugin-for-instrumentation#deactivate-auto-instrumentation "Learn how to configure the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin to adjust the auto-instrumentation process.")
* [Automatic OneAgent startup](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/configure-plugin-for-instrumentation#auto-startup "Learn how to configure the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin to adjust the auto-instrumentation process.")
* [Exclusion of certain classes and methods](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/configure-plugin-for-instrumentation#exclude-certain-classes-and-methods "Learn how to configure the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin to adjust the auto-instrumentation process.")
* [Adjusting test case instrumentation](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/configure-plugin-for-instrumentation#adjust-test-case-instrumentation "Learn how to configure the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin to adjust the auto-instrumentation process.")

### Adjust OneAgent configuration

The following configuration options can be used to adjust the default OneAgent configuration:

* [Data privacy](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/adjust-oneagent-configuration#data-privacy "Learn how to configure the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin to modify the OneAgent SDK configuration.")
* [Hybrid apps that use RUM JavaScript inside `WebView`](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/adjust-oneagent-configuration#hybrid-apps "Learn how to configure the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin to modify the OneAgent SDK configuration.")
* [Adjust OneAgent behavior](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/adjust-oneagent-configuration#adjust-oneagent-behavior "Learn how to configure the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin to modify the OneAgent SDK configuration.")

These options are especially helpful when used along with the automatic OneAgent startup. They can also be used to adjust the OneAgent configuration when approached with the manual startup, but you need to be careful because the settings can easily be overridden with `ConfigurationBuilder`.

### Adjust Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin configuration based on the project structure

Our plugin scans all subprojects and configures the auto-instrumentation process for your application modules. Other modules are unaffected by the plugin. In this case, you might need to adjust the instrumentation process for an Android project with:

* [Library modules](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/configure-multi-module-projects#library-modules "Use the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin for less common project architectures.")
* [Feature modules](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/configure-multi-module-projects#feature-modules "Use the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin for less common project architectures.")
* [Multiple application modules](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/configure-multi-module-projects#multiple-application-modules "Use the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin for less common project architectures.")
* [Multiple application modules and feature modules](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/configure-multi-module-projects#application-and-feature-modules "Use the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin for less common project architectures.")
* [One build file](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/configure-multi-module-projects#one-build-file "Use the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin for less common project architectures.")

# Instrument Android apps

# Instrument Android apps

* Overview
* 2-min read
* Updated on Oct 07, 2025

The process of monitoring the user experience of native mobile applications is different from monitoring browser-based web applications. This is because mobile app monitoring involves the compilation, packaging, and shipment of a monitoring library along with your own mobile application package.

To leverage Dynatrace for your Android app, check the [get started guide](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/get-started-with-android-monitoring "Learn the steps you need to perform to instrument your Android app for monitoring with Dynatrace.") for an overview of the required steps.

You can also explore our new [demo mobile applicationï»¿](https://dt-url.net/rs0229z) to get a feel of how the instrumentation with Dynatrace works. This sample application showcases the main features provided by the [Dynatrace Android Gradle Plugin](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin "Learn how the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin can auto-instrument your Android application project.") and the [OneAgent SDK for Android](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-oneagent-sdk "Learn what OneAgent SDK for Android is.").

[Jetpack Compose auto-instrumentation](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/monitoring-capabilities#compose-instrumentation "Configure the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin to adjust the monitoring capabilities of OneAgent.") is enabled by default starting with Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin version 8.271.

Jetpack Compose auto-instrumentation for [Session Replay](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-replay "Learn how you can use Session Replay to better understand and troubleshoot errors experienced by your customers.") is enabled by default starting with Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin version 8.325.

# Instrument hybrid apps

* How-to guide
* 4-min read
* Published Aug 10, 2021

With Dynatrace, you can set up Real User Monitoring for various types of hybrid and cross-platform mobile applications.

You can instrument your mobile application using one of our plugins. However, if you are using a hybrid platform that doesn't support our plugins or your requirements disallow third-party plugins, follow the steps below to instrument your hybrid application.

[![Step 1](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-1-086e22066c.svg "Step 1")

**Create a hybrid application in Dynatrace**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-hybrid-app#create-app-in-ui "Learn how you can instrument various types of hybrid and cross-platform mobile apps.")[![Step 2](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-2-1a1384627e.svg "Step 2")

**Set up OneAgent and adjust its configuration**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-hybrid-app#set-up-oneagent "Learn how you can instrument various types of hybrid and cross-platform mobile apps.")[![Step 3](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-3-350cf6c19a.svg "Step 3")

**Insert the RUM JavaScript into your hybrid app's HTML files**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-hybrid-app#add-rum-js "Learn how you can instrument various types of hybrid and cross-platform mobile apps.")

For hybrid applications, the native app is monitored via OneAgent for Mobile, while the browser part is observed by the Dynatrace RUM JavaScript.

For hybrid apps, a user session is billed only once. See [Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM units)](/docs/license/monitoring-consumption-classic/digital-experience-monitoring-units "Understand how Dynatrace Digital Experience Monitoring consumption is calculated based on DEM units.") for more details.

Also note that one "hybrid" session might be displayed as two separate sessions in Dynatrace: one as a web session and another as a mobile session.

## Step 1 Create a hybrid application in Dynatrace

The first step is to create a hybrid application that consists of two parts:

* **Mobile application** gets the monitoring data from the native part of a hybrid app. User actions and crashes from the mobile app are reported to this application.
* **Web application** captures data from the browser part of a hybrid app. User actions from the web views are reported to this web application.

To create an application in Dynatrace

1. In Dynatrace, go to **Mobile**.
2. Select **Create mobile app**.
3. Enter a name for your application and select **Create mobile app**. The application settings page opens.
4. From the application settings, select **Instrumentation wizard** > **Cordova**.
5. Follow the steps described in the wizard. Do not forget to select **Monitor the web view** to create a web application.

   ![Monitor web view via Cordova wizard](https://dt-cdn.net/images/monitor-web-view-cordova-wizard-2440-449be51ccc.png)

   If the app that you're instrumenting is not a [Cordova app](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/cross-platform-frameworks/apache-cordova "Set up Dynatrace to monitor hybrid mobile apps with the Cordova plugin."), skip the steps related to the Cordova plugin.

## Step 2 Set up OneAgent and adjust its configuration

Use OneAgent for Mobile to instrument the native part of your hybrid application. The mobile application that you've created in step 1 offers you instrumentation wizards for the native part of your application.

Android

iOS

To auto-instrument your Android project, use the [Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin "Learn how the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin can auto-instrument your Android application project.").

After that, [adjust the default configuration](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/adjust-oneagent-configuration#hybrid-apps "Learn how to configure the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin to modify the OneAgent SDK configuration.") to allow OneAgent to pass cookies to the WebView and domains specified in your app's top-level build file.

Here is the example configuration for the `easytravel.com` domain:

```
dynatrace {



configurations {



sampleConfig {



hybridWebView {



enabled true



domains '.easytravel.com'



}



}



}



}
```

To monitor your iOS application, you need to instrument [OneAgent for iOS](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/dynatrace-auto-instrumentation-for-ios "Set up user experience monitoring for iOS apps within Dynatrace.").

After that, use the [`DTXHybridApplication`, `DTXSetCookiesForDomain`, and `DTXSetSecureCookiesForDomain` configuration keys](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys#hybrid "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.") to allow OneAgent to pass cookies to `WKWebView` and domains specified in your app's [`Info.plist` file](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/info-plist-file "Info.plist file stores your app identification and configuration keys. Use it to fine-tune the instrumentation configuration.").

Here is the example configuration for the `easytravel.com` domain:

```
<key>DTXHybridApplication</key>



<true/>



<key>DTXSetCookiesForDomain</key>



<array>



<string>.easytravel.com</string>



</array>



<key>DTXSetSecureCookiesForDomain</key>



<array>



<string>.example.com</string>



</array>
```

Apple Pay does not work in WKWebView

When the `DTXHybridApplication` configuration key is set to `true`, Apple Pay does not work on webpages loaded in `WKWebView`.

To protect the security of transactions in `WKWebView`, Apple [disallows the use of Apple Pay with script injection APIsï»¿](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-release-notes/safari-13-release-notes#Payment-Request-API), such as `WKUserScript` or `evaluateJavaScript`. Dynatrace uses `evaluateJavascript` to pass the correlation data from the native layer to `WKWebView`, and this process disables Apple Pay.

As a workaround, set the `DTXHybridApplication` [configuration key](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.") to `false` to stop the injection of the script from OneAgent. However, this will also remove the correlation of mobile and web sessions for your hybrid app. Corresponding mobile and web sessions will not be merged, which leads to two billed sessions instead of one.

It is important to add the required domains to your top-level build file (Android) or [`Info.plist` file](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/info-plist-file "Info.plist file stores your app identification and configuration keys. Use it to fine-tune the instrumentation configuration.") (iOS) so that Dynatrace can identify mobile and web sessions within your app and merge these sessions into the same "hybrid" session.

## Step 3 Insert the RUM JavaScript into HTML sources

To capture user actions in the web-based part of your hybrid application, use the RUM JavaScript. You'll need to manually insert the JavaScript code or tag into your HTML sources. See [Set up agentless Real User Monitoring](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/set-up-agentless-real-user-monitoring "Set up agentless monitoring for your web applications.") for more information. Note that the RUM JavaScript is available in [several formats](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case").

After you add the RUM JavaScript to the HTML files, user actions from your hybrid app's web views are reported to the web application that you've created in step 1.

If you've already instrumented the web-based part of your hybrid app, then you don't need to manually add the RUM JavaScript to the HTML sources of your app.

# OneAgent for iOS configuration keys

# OneAgent for iOS configuration keys

* How-to guide
* 11-min read
* Updated on Jan 02, 2026

Configuration keys are essentially properties you can set to your preferences for auto-instrumentation. Add the keys to your app's [`Info.plist` file](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/info-plist-file "Info.plist file stores your app identification and configuration keys. Use it to fine-tune the instrumentation configuration."), as required to fine-tune auto-instrumentation.

The following tables include all configuration keys for iOS auto-instrumentation.

## General

Key

Key type

Description

Default value

`DTXApplicationID`

Required

string

Identifies your mobile app. Auto-instrumentation reports an error if the key isn't present.

`DTXBeaconURL`

Required

string

This key's value is used to identify your environment within Dynatrace. Auto-instrumentation reports an error if the key is not present.

`DTXAutoStart`

boolean

When set to `false`, OneAgent doesn't start automatically, so you should [start it manually](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/oneagent-sdk-for-ios#start-oneagent "Enrich mobile user experience monitoring using OneAgent SDK for iOS.").

`true`

`DTXStartupLoadBalancing`

boolean

When set to `true`, enables agent-side load balancing on startup, which avoids unbalanced load on the server when multiple OneAgents simultaneously establish a connection to the ActiveGate.

`false`

`DTXLogLevel`

string

If this key is present with a valid value, [OneAgent logging](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/logging-for-ios "Turn on debug logging for OneAgent.") is automatically enabled with the set value. If a key isn't present or doesn't have a valid value, automatic logging is turned off and must be turned on manually via API call.

**Possible values**: `OFF`, `SEVERE`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, `ALL`

`OFF`

`DTXStartupWithGrailEnabled`

boolean

When set to `true`, the New RUM Experience is enabled on the first app start, before the cluster configuration is received. This setting has no effect after the first app start. Once cluster configuration is received, it permanently overrides this flag.

`false`

## User actions

Key

Key type

Description

Default value

`DTXInstrumentAutoUserAction`

boolean

Turns on the ability to automatically [create user actions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/ios-auto-instrumentation-features#user-actions "Explore the list of features that are available after you instrument your application with OneAgent.") for user interactions with the app, such as button clicks. Set the value to `false` to disable automatic creation of user actions.

`true`

`DTXExcludedControlClasses`

array

An array of items where each item contains the name of a UI control class (or sub-class) to exclude from automatic control instrumentation. Each item in the array is a case-sensitive string that must exactly match the name of the class to be excluded.

`DTXExcludedControls`

array

Defines an array of items where each item contains a type of view or control to exclude from automatic creation of user actions. Each item in the array is a case-insensitive string.

**Possible values**: `Button`, `DatePicker`, `Slider`, `Stepper`, `Switch`, `RefreshControl`, `ToolBar`, `SegmentedControl`, `TableView`, `TabBar`, `AlertView`, `AlertAction`, `PageView`, `NavigationController`, `CollectionView`, `ActionSheet`, `PickerView`

`DTXUIActionNamePrivacy`[1](#fn-1-1-def)

boolean

When set to `true`, enables [user action masking](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/oneagent-sdk-for-ios#mask-user-actions "Enrich mobile user experience monitoring using OneAgent SDK for iOS.").

* **UIKit-based apps**. OneAgent replaces control titles in user action names with generic control types.
* **SwiftUI-based apps**. OneAgent doesn't report the child events that contain the control titles of "touch" user actions.

As a result, all `Touch on <control title>` user action names are changed to `Touch on <generic control type>`. For example, `Touch on Account 123456` becomes `Touch on Button`.

`false`

`DTXDetectRageTaps`

boolean

Defines if [rage tap detection](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/ios-auto-instrumentation-features#rage-taps "Explore the list of features that are available after you instrument your application with OneAgent.") is enabled or not. Use this feature as a measure of user frustration. Set the value to `false` to stop detecting rage taps.

`true`

`DTXSendEmptyAutoAction`

boolean

Determines whether to send automatic user actions that don't contain any web requests or lifecycle actions.

`true`

`DTXAutoActionMaxDurationMilliseconds`

number

Sets the amount of time to retain an automatic user action before deletion. The purpose is to detect all web requests that occur when an automatic user action is active. If an automatic user action has pending web requests that are taking longer to complete, OneAgent waits for this amount of time for the web requests to complete before leaving the user action.

**Possible values**: from `100` ms (= 0.1 seconds) to `540000` ms (= 9 minutes)

`60000` ms

`DTXAutoActionTimeoutMilliseconds`

number

Sets the value for how long a particular automatic user action is active. The purpose is to detect all web requests that occur when an automatic user action is active. If the automatic user action has completed web requests, OneAgent leaves the action at the end of this time.

**Possible values**: from `100` ms (= 0.1 seconds) to `5000` ms (= 5 seconds)

`500` ms

1

Available for OneAgent for iOS version 8.249+

## Web requests

Key

Key type

Description

Default value

`DTXInstrumentWebRequestTiming`

boolean

Turns on automatic [web request timing and tagging](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/ios-auto-instrumentation-features#web-requests "Explore the list of features that are available after you instrument your application with OneAgent."). To [disable automatic web request timing and tagging](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/oneagent-sdk-for-ios#disable-auto-request-instrumentation "Enrich mobile user experience monitoring using OneAgent SDK for iOS."), set the value to `false`.

`true`

`DTXURLFilters`

array

An array of items where each item contains the URL filters to exclude web requests from monitoring. Each item in the array should be a URL string or regular expression matching the URL your want to filter.

`DTXFilterURLProtocolDuplicates`

boolean

Required if NSURLProtocol subclassing is used and duplicate web requests may appear.

`false`

## Lifecycle monitoring

Key

Key type

Description

Default value

`DTXInstrumentLifecycleMonitoring`

boolean

Enables automatic [lifecycle detection](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/ios-auto-instrumentation-features#lifecycle "Explore the list of features that are available after you instrument your application with OneAgent.") for iOS `ViewController` classes. To disable automatic lifecycle monitoring, set the value to `false`.

`true`

`DTXInstrumentFrameworks`[1](#fn-2-1-def)

obsolete

boolean

Enables automatic lifecycle instrumentation of UI classes from third-party frameworks that are bundled with the application. Set the value to `true` to enable automatic third-party framework lifecycle instrumentation. This configuration requires OneAgent for iOS to scan all frameworks bundled with your application, which can result in a noticeable performance impact at the application start.

`false`

`DTXExcludedLifecycleClasses`

array

An array of items where each item contains the name of a class to exclude from automatic lifecycle instrumentation. Each item in the array is a case-sensitive string that must exactly match the name of the class to be excluded.

1

Obsolete starting with OneAgent for iOS version 8.331

## Hybrid apps

Key

Key type

Description

Default value

`DTXHybridApplication`

boolean

For [hybrid apps](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-hybrid-app "Learn how you can instrument various types of hybrid and cross-platform mobile apps."), set the value to `true`. This is necessary to share the same visit for user actions created by the RUM JavaScript.

`false`

`DTXSetCookiesForDomain`

array[string]

For hybrid apps that use the RUM JavaScript, [cookies must be set](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-hybrid-app#set-up-oneagent "Learn how you can instrument various types of hybrid and cross-platform mobile apps.") for each instrumented domain or server that the app communicates with. You can specify domains, host, or IP addresses. Domains and sub-domains must start with a dot.

`DTXSetSecureCookiesForDomain`

array[string]

For hybrid apps that use the RUM JavaScript, [cookies must be set](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-hybrid-app#set-up-oneagent "Learn how you can instrument various types of hybrid and cross-platform mobile apps.") for each instrumented domain or server that the app communicates with. You can specify domains, host, or IP addresses. Domains and sub-domains must start with a dot.
This configuration key is similar to `DTXSetCookiesForDomain`, but the `Secure` cookie attribute is added for cookies that are set by Dynatrace. This ensures that the browser sends these cookies only over secure connections.

`DTXInstrumentWebViewTiming`

boolean

Turns on automatic [web request timing and tagging for requests passed to `WKWebView`](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/ios-auto-instrumentation-features#web-requests-wkwebview "Explore the list of features that are available after you instrument your application with OneAgent."). This doesn't work for requests issued from JavaScript inside `WKWebView`. Set the value to `false` to disable automatic web request timing and tagging.

`true`

`DTXWebViewStandInDelegate`[1](#fn-3-1-def)

obsolete

boolean

Use different instrumentation mode for `WKWebView` delegates to prevent circular instrumentation on delegate switching involving a subclass.

`false`

1

Obsolete starting with OneAgent for iOS version 8.257

## Privacy and security

Key

Key type

Description

Default value

`DTXUserOptIn`

boolean

When set to `true`, activates [user opt-in mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile#opt-in-mode-mobile "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.").

When user opt-in mode is enabled, you need to ask each user for permission to capture their data; then, you store their data privacy preferences. For details, see [Configure data privacy](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/oneagent-sdk-for-ios#privacy "Enrich mobile user experience monitoring using OneAgent SDK for iOS.").

`false`

`DTXCrashReportingEnabled`

boolean

Enables [crash reporting](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/ios-auto-instrumentation-features#crashes "Explore the list of features that are available after you instrument your application with OneAgent."). To disable crash reporting, set the value to `false`.

`true`

`DTXInstrumentGPSLocation`

boolean

When set to `true`, enables [location monitoring](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/ios-auto-instrumentation-features#location "Explore the list of features that are available after you instrument your application with OneAgent."). The location is captured when the app uses `CLLocationManager` and sends the captured location as a metric to the server. The OneAgent SDK for iOS doesn't perform GPS location capture on its own; to protect the privacy of the end user, it only captures a precision of three fractional digits.

`false`

`DTXPublicKeyPins`

array[string]

Includes the `getPKHashFromCertificate.py` script outputs used to enable the [Public Key Hash Pinning](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/configuration-settings#pkh-pinning "Configure auto-instrumentation for iOS apps using advanced settings.") feature for your mobile app.

`DTXAgentCertificatePath`

string

Defines the path to a (self-signed) certificate in `DER` format, which is used as an additional anchor to validate HTTPS communication. This key is needed if `DTXAllowAnyCert` is `false` and a self-signed certificate is used on the server.

`null`

`DTXAllowAnyCert`

boolean

Allows the use of self-signed certificates. When set to `true`, OneAgent for iOS accepts self-signed certificates (certificates that are not signed by a `root-CA`). This configuration key doesn't impact mobile app connections. It's only used for OneAgent communication, but doesn't overrule the host-name validation.

`false`

`DTXWriteLogsToFile`

boolean

When set to `true`, enables OneAgent to write logs to the device's local storage. This flag is required to be set to `true` for using the [`shareLogsFile`](/docs/manage/data-privacy-and-security/data-privacy/personal-data-captured-by-dynatrace#log-sharing "Find out what types of end-user data may be captured during Dynatrace monitoring and the methods that are available for masking personal end-user data.") API, which allows sharing of logs via an iOS sharing sheet (`UIActivityViewController`). This feature is not available on tvOS.

`false`

`DTXANRReportingEnabled`

boolean

Enables reporting of "Application Not Responding" (ANR) errors. To disable ANR reporting, set this value to `false`.

`true`

`DTXANRTimeout`

number

Sets the "Application Not Responding" (ANR) detection timeout. Change this value to adapt the timeout required for an ANR to be detected.

**Possible values**: from `1` second to `20` seconds

`2`

## SwiftUI

Key

Key type

Description

Default value

`DTXSwiftUIEnableSessionReplayInstrumentation`[1](#fn-4-1-def)

boolean

When set to `true`, enables [Session Replay for your SwiftUI apps](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-replay/session-replay-ios#sr-swiftui "Prerequisites and the procedure for enabling Session Replay for your iOS apps.").

`false`

`DTXExcludedSwiftUIFiles`[1](#fn-4-1-def)

array[string]

Includes relative paths of files and directories that are [excluded from the SwiftUI instrumentation](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/instrument-swiftui-controls#exclude-swift-files "Use the Dynatrace SwiftUI instrumentor to monitor your SwiftUI apps."). The paths are relative to the project root, which is the directory where the `.xcodeproj` file is located.

`DTXSwiftUIExcludedControls`[3](#fn-4-3-def)

array[string]

Specifies SwiftUI controls that are [globally excluded from the SwiftUI instrumentation](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/instrument-swiftui-controls#exclude-controls-global "Use the Dynatrace SwiftUI instrumentor to monitor your SwiftUI apps.").

**Possible values**: all values under [Supported controls](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/instrument-swiftui-controls#supported-controls "Use the Dynatrace SwiftUI instrumentor to monitor your SwiftUI apps.")

`DTXSwiftUIInstrumentSimulatorBuilds`[1](#fn-4-1-def)

boolean

When set to `true`, enables the [SwiftUI instrumentation for simulator builds](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/instrument-swiftui-controls#instrument-simulator-builds "Use the Dynatrace SwiftUI instrumentor to monitor your SwiftUI apps.").

`DTXSwiftUIIgnoreDeploymentTarget`[1](#fn-4-1-def)

boolean

When set to `true`, allows you to [generate builds for deployment targets of iOS 13 and earlier](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/instrument-swiftui-controls#builds-for-unsupported-deployment-targets "Use the Dynatrace SwiftUI instrumentor to monitor your SwiftUI apps.").

`DTXSwiftUIManualPlaceholder`[1](#fn-4-1-def)

When set to `true`, [enables line number mapping](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/instrument-swiftui-controls#line-number-mapping-objective-c "Use the Dynatrace SwiftUI instrumentor to monitor your SwiftUI apps.") for legacy Objective-C projects. Note that additional configuration is required.

`DTXCleanSwiftUILogsByCount`[2](#fn-4-2-def)

number

Sets the number of builds after which the [SwiftUI instrumentor logs are deleted](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/instrument-swiftui-controls#enable-log-cleanup "Use the Dynatrace SwiftUI instrumentor to monitor your SwiftUI apps.").

**Possible values**: from `1` to `1000`

`DTXCleanSwiftUILogsByAgeDays`[2](#fn-4-2-def)

number

Sets the number of days after which the [SwiftUI instrumentor logs are deleted](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/instrument-swiftui-controls#enable-log-cleanup "Use the Dynatrace SwiftUI instrumentor to monitor your SwiftUI apps.").

# Info.plist file

# Info.plist file

* Explanation
* 2-min read
* Updated on Apr 26, 2024

When you use Dynatrace, the `Info.plist` file stores your app identification and configuration keys. Below is some information on this file.

* The `Info.plist` file is available in the Xcode project navigator under **Supporting Files**. For older project files, `Info.plist` is located under **Resources**.
* Regardless of the selected approach to setting up RUM for your app, add your app identification keys (app ID and beacon URL) to your project's `Info.plist` file; the [`DTXApplicationID` and `DTXBeaconURL` keys](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys#general "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.") are always required. Without the app identification keys, your mobile app won't be able to send monitoring data to Dynatrace.

  To check your app identification keys, access the [mobile instrumentation wizard](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/dynatrace-auto-instrumentation-for-ios#instrumentation-wizard "Set up user experience monitoring for iOS apps within Dynatrace.").
* You can also use `Info.plist` to enable or disable additional monitoring features by adding [configuration keys](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.") to this file.
* To keep your app's `Info.plist` file clean, you can move all OneAgent-related `DTX` keys to a `Dynatrace.plist` file and add `Dynatrace.plist` to the `Copy Bundle Resources` build phase. The `Dynatrace.plist` file must be located at the root of your resources bundle, so create this file in the same location as the `Info.plist` file.
* In some instances, no `Info.plist` file is generated when you use Xcode. For example, when you create a new SwiftUI project, you might notice the project doesn't have this file. See [Xcode Release Notes; issue 68254857ï»¿](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-13-release-notes#Templates) for more details.

  If you don't have the `Info.plist` file, add your app identification keys and [configuration keys](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.") manually as **Custom iOS Target Properties** to the **Info** tab of your application target. Once you make that change, Xcode adds the `Info.plist` file to the project, but it's still better to update the configuration via the **Info** tab of your application target.

# Instrument SwiftUI controls

# Instrument SwiftUI controls

* How-to guide
* 13-min read
* Updated on May 22, 2025

OneAgent for iOS version 8.249+

After [instrumenting your mobile app with OneAgent for iOS](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/dynatrace-auto-instrumentation-for-ios "Set up user experience monitoring for iOS apps within Dynatrace."), you might also want to instrument your app's SwiftUI controls. This page provides additional information on how to set up your project, update our SwiftUI instrumentor, overcome some known limitations, and more.

To instrument SwiftUI controls, our SwiftUI instrumentor adds additional code to your project's source code (`*.swift` files) during the build process. This code observes the state of UI elements and notifies the OneAgent for iOS about any updates. After the build process is completed, all changes to your project's source code are reverted.

For detailed information on actions performed by the SwiftUI instrumentor and a copy of the altered code files, check the `dynatrace_instrumented` directory. The SwiftUI instrumentor creates backups of the instrumented files and generated logs in ZIP archive format.

## Requirements

* SwiftUI version 2.0+
* iOS 14+

[![Step 1](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-1-086e22066c.svg "Step 1")

**Create an application in Dynatrace**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/dynatrace-auto-instrumentation-for-ios#create-app-in-ui "Set up user experience monitoring for iOS apps within Dynatrace.")[![Step 2](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-2-1a1384627e.svg "Step 2")

**Set up OneAgent for your project**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/dynatrace-auto-instrumentation-for-ios#set-up-oneagent "Set up user experience monitoring for iOS apps within Dynatrace.")[![Step 3](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-3-350cf6c19a.svg "Step 3")

**Install our SwiftUI instrumentor**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/instrument-swiftui-controls#install-instrumentor "Use the Dynatrace SwiftUI instrumentor to monitor your SwiftUI apps.")

## Manage SwiftUI instrumentor

### Install the instrumentor

To instrument your app's SwiftUI controls, install the Dynatrace SwiftUI instrumentor. You can do that via Homebrew or manually.

[OneAgent for iOS](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/dynatrace-auto-instrumentation-for-ios "Set up user experience monitoring for iOS apps within Dynatrace.") should already be set up for your project. Also, don't forget to back up your project before installing the instrumentor.

Homebrew

Manual

1. Run `brew tap dynatrace/tools` to add one of the Dynatrace taps.
2. Run `brew install DTSwiftInstrumentor` to install our SwiftUI instrumentor.
3. Quit Xcode and execute `DTSwiftInstrumentor install`.

   * Optional Additionally, you can specify `<PROJECT.xcodeproj> --scheme <SCHEME> --target <TARGET>`. If no project details are provided, the tool tries to auto-detect the available targets and schemes and start an interactive selection.

1. Download and extract the ZIP file containing our SwiftUI instrumentor. The link is available in the [mobile instrumentation wizard](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/dynatrace-auto-instrumentation-for-ios#instrumentation-wizard "Set up user experience monitoring for iOS apps within Dynatrace.").
2. Create a `.dynatrace` folder in your project rootâon the same level as the `*.xcodeproj` file.

   If you receive a system warning stating that you cannot create a folder with a name that begins with a dot, do one of the following:

   * In Terminal, run `mkdir .dynatrace` inside the project root to create a `.dynatrace` folder.
   * In Terminal, run `defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles true` and `killall Finder` to show hidden folders and files. Then create a `.dynatrace` folder in Finder.

     You can also run `defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles false` and `killall Finder` to hide hidden folders and files back.
3. Copy the downloaded `DTSwiftInstrumentor` to the `.dynatrace` folder and make sure that the file is executable.
4. Quit Xcode, and execute `.dynatrace/DTSwiftInstrumentor install <PROJECT.xcodeproj> --scheme <SCHEME> --target <TARGET>`.

If an error occurs during the implementation, check the Xcode build log or the instrumentation log for detailed information on the error. For additional hints, refer to [Mobile applications: Issues with SwiftUI instrumentationï»¿](https://dt-url.net/yh638kl) in the Dynatrace Community.

When you build your app, you should do that with the scheme that you've instrumented.

### Update the instrumentor

When the new version of the SwiftUI instrumentor is available, you can update it via Homebrew or manually.

Homebrew

Manual

Once released, new versions of the instrumentor are loaded through the added tap.

Run `brew update` and `brew upgrade DTSwiftInstrumentor` to update our SwiftUI instrumentor.

1. Download and extract the ZIP file containing the new version of the SwiftUI instrumentor. The link is available in the [mobile instrumentation wizard](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/dynatrace-auto-instrumentation-for-ios#instrumentation-wizard "Set up user experience monitoring for iOS apps within Dynatrace.").
2. Copy the downloaded `DTSwiftInstrumentor` to the `.dynatrace` folder, and replace the existing file.

If you see the following build warning, you also need to update the build scripts that were integrated during the installation of the Dynatrace SwiftUI instrumentor.

```
Dynatrace: There is an upgrade for your project instrumentation. Please execute "DTSwiftInstrumentor project-upgrade <PROJECT.xcodeproj>" to upgrade your project
```

Run the suggested command to update the build scripts, and then save the changes made to your project file.

### Uninstall the instrumentor

If you no longer need the Dynatrace SwiftUI instrumentor, you can delete it from your system via Homebrew, or you can manually remove it from your project.

Homebrew

Manual

Run `brew remove DTSwiftInstrumentor` and `brew untap dynatrace/tools` to remove our SwiftUI instrumentor from your system.

1. Run `DTSwiftInstrumentor uninstall` to remove the SwiftUI instrumentor from your project.

   * Optional Additionally, you can specify `<PROJECT.xcodeproj>`. If no project details are provided, the tool tries to auto-detect and start an interactive selection.
2. Optional Delete the `.dynatrace` and `dynatrace_instrumented` folders from your project.

   These folders contain cache, log data, and, if applicable, manually setup instrumentor binary.
   These folders contain the instrumentor cache, log data, and, if applicable, instrumentor binaries.

## Check SwiftUI instrumentation diff

OneAgent for iOS version 8.257+

To check the difference between your original code and the code modified by the SwiftUI instrumentor, run one of the following commands:

* From the project root:

  + `DTSwiftInstrumentor diff` if you installed the instrumentor via Homebrew
  + `.dynatrace/DTSwiftInstrumentor diff` if you installed the instrumentor manually
* From any directory

  + `DTSwiftInstrumentor diff <root-project-dir-path>`

## Known limitations

### Instrumentation of custom SwiftUI controls not supported

Currently, Dynatrace doesn't support the instrumentation of custom SwiftUI controls. For the list of SwiftUI controls that you can instrument, see [Supported controls](#supported-controls).

### Issue with previews in Xcode

When a simulator build included the SwiftUI instrumentation, the previews were not loaded in Xcode. As a workaround, we disabled the SwiftUI instrumentation for simulator builds. If you want to add the SwiftUI instrumentation to simulator builds, see [Instrument simulator builds](#instrument-simulator-builds).

### SwiftUI 2.0+ only

Dynatrace supports SwiftUI 2.0+ instrumentation because the `onChange` listener is unavailable in earlier SwiftUI releases. For this reason, a deployment target needs to be of iOS 14+.

### Longer build time

Unlike the OneAgent for iOS that modifies your mobile app in memory during runtime, the SwiftUI instrumentor alters your project's source code during build time. For this reason, the SwiftUI instrumentation process has a noticeable impact on the build time.

To decrease the build time

* Build only for **Device**. If you've decided to [instrument simulator builds](#instrument-simulator-builds), disable that feature.
* Don't run SwiftUI instrumentation on every possible build. We suggest running SwiftUI instrumentation on branches like `main` or `release`.

### watchOS incompatibility

It's impossible to compile a project containing files that are added to a watchOS target, as there is no OneAgent for watchOS. In this case, [manually exclude](#exclude-swift-files) all files that are shared with or part of a watchOS target.

### tvOS not supported

Currently, there is no official support for tvOS SwiftUI builds.

## SwiftUI control labels

Unless specified otherwise, the Dynatrace SwiftUI instrumentor attempts to fetch each control name by recursively searching for string literals or variables provided as a title.
In the example below, the instrumentor will extract `"Login"` as a label for the button:

```
Button("Login", action: {



/* perform login */



})
```

The extracted label will be used to report a `"Touch on Login"` auto action when a user interacts with the button.

In the following example, a user interaction with this button would be reported as `"Touch on bookmark"`:

```
Button(action: {



print("Hello world!")



}) {



Image("bookmark")



}
```

### Use a default control name

Use the `withCustomInstrumentationConfig(.useDefaultControlName)` modifier to set the control label to `<Control type>_<index>`:

```
Button("Login", action: {



/* perform login */



}).withCustomInstrumentationConfig(.useDefaultControlName)
```

When the modifier is applied, the instrumentor will report the touch action as `"Touch on Button_0"`.

### Use a custom control name

Use the `withCustomInstrumentationConfig(.useControlName(<Name>)` modifier to specify a custom label for a certain control as follows:

```
Button("Login", action: {



/* perform login */



}).withCustomInstrumentationConfig(.useControlName("Login Button"))
```

This way, every touch on the button would be reported as `"Touch on Login Button"`.

## Configure SwiftUI instrumentation

### Enable Session Replay on crashes

Session Replay on crashes can capture and visually replay the actions that your application user performed before a [crash](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#crash "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace.") occurred.

To turn this feature on, see [Enable Session Replay for SwiftUI apps](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-replay/session-replay-ios#sr-swiftui "Prerequisites and the procedure for enabling Session Replay for your iOS apps.").

### Globally exclude controls from SwiftUI instrumentation

OneAgent for iOS version 8.263+

The Dynatrace SwiftUI instrumentor instruments all UI elements listed under [Supported controls](#supported-controls). When required, you can globally exclude certain controls from the SwiftUI instrumentation process.

To globally exclude controls from the SwiftUI instrumentation, add the [`DTXSwiftUIExcludedControls` configuration key](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys#swiftui "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.") to your project's [`Info.plist` file](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/info-plist-file "Info.plist file stores your app identification and configuration keys. Use it to fine-tune the instrumentation configuration.").

```
<key>DTXExcludedSwiftUIFiles</key>



<array>



<string>Button</string>



<string>Slider</string>



</array>
```

### Locally exclude controls from SwiftUI instrumentation

OneAgent for iOS version 8.263+

With the `withCustomInstrumentationConfig(.skipInstrumentation)` function, you can locally exclude controls from SwiftUI instrumentation.

In contrast to the [`DTXSwiftUIExcludedControls` configuration key](#exclude-controls-global), which allows you to prevent the instrumentation of all instances of a specified control type, the `withCustomInstrumentationConfig(.skipInstrumentation)` function can be used to exclude a specific instance of a control type. You can apply this function directly to a control or, to exclude multiple control instances, to a container.

Follow these guidelines when applying the `withCustomInstrumentationConfig(.skipInstrumentation)` function:

* To use the function, first add the `import Dynatrace` import statement.
* Add `withCustomInstrumentationConfig(.skipInstrumentation)` as the last modifier in the list of the view modifiers. For example:

  ```
  Button("Login", action: { /* perform login */ })



  .padding()



  .background(Color.red)



  .frame(width: 40)



  .withCustomInstrumentationConfig(.skipInstrumentation)
  ```

#### Exclude a single control

Use the following code to locally exclude a single control from the SwiftUI instrumentation:

```
import Dynatrace



â¦



Button("Login", action: { /* perform login */ })



.withCustomInstrumentationConfig(.skipInstrumentation)
```

#### Exclude multiple controls

To locally exclude a group of controls, apply the `withCustomInstrumentationConfig(.skipInstrumentation)` function to their parent container.

```
import Dynatrace



â¦



HStack {



Button("Login", action: { /* perform login */ })



Button("Register", action: { /* perform registration */ })



}.withCustomInstrumentationConfig(.skipInstrumentation)
```

### Exclude files from SwiftUI instrumentation

By default, the Dynatrace SwiftUI instrumentor processes all files with a `.swift` file extension, but it only instruments files that contain the [supported controls](#supported-controls). When required, you can exclude certain files and directories from the SwiftUI instrumentation process.

To exclude files and directories from the SwiftUI instrumentation

1. Add the [`DTXExcludedSwiftUIFiles` configuration key](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys#swiftui "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.") to your project's [`Info.plist` file](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/info-plist-file "Info.plist file stores your app identification and configuration keys. Use it to fine-tune the instrumentation configuration.").
2. List relative paths of all files and directories that you don't want to instrument. The paths should be relative to the project root, which is the directory where the `.xcodeproj` file is located.

   ```
   <key>DTXExcludedSwiftUIFiles</key>



   <array>



   <string>relative/file/path/</string>



   <string>relative/file.swift</string>



   </array>
   ```

The instrumentation log, which is available after each build, contains the list of files and directories that should be excluded from the SwiftUI instrumentation. The instrumentation log also shows you if a file or directory was excluded during the instrumentation process.

### Instrument simulator builds

We disabled the SwiftUI instrumentation for simulator builds to overcome an [issue with the previews in Xcode](#issue-preview-xcode).

To enable the SwiftUI instrumentation for simulator builds, add the [`DTXSwiftUIInstrumentSimulatorBuilds` configuration key](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys#swiftui "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.") to your project's [`Info.plist` file](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/info-plist-file "Info.plist file stores your app identification and configuration keys. Use it to fine-tune the instrumentation configuration.") and set this key to `true`.

```
<key>DTXSwiftUIInstrumentSimulatorBuilds</key>



<true/>
```

### Create builds for unsupported deployment targets

Our SwiftUI instrumentor generates SwiftUI 2.0+ compatible code that only runs on devices with iOS 14+. The attempt to generate builds for deployment targets of iOS 13 and earlier will fail.

To override this check, add the [`DTXSwiftUIIgnoreDeploymentTarget` configuration key](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys#swiftui "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.") to your project's [`Info.plist` file](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/info-plist-file "Info.plist file stores your app identification and configuration keys. Use it to fine-tune the instrumentation configuration.") and set this key to `true`.

```
<key>DTXSwiftUIIgnoreDeploymentTarget</key>



<true/>
```

### Enable line number mapping for Objective-C projects

Crash reports that are available in Dynatrace are not based on the source code of your project. These reports are based on the altered code that Dynatrace generates during instrumentation. This is why line number mapping is added to your project during instrumentation and later passed to Dynatrace on app launch. Otherwise, the line numbers in crash reports would be incorrect.

By default, the Dynatrace SwiftUI instrumentor generates a line number mapping and inserts it into your project's main class. This happens automatically for projects with a Swift main class, but not for legacy Objective-C projects. For such projects, you'll get an error, and our SwiftUI instrumentor won't instrument your mobile app.

To enable line number mapping for Objective-C projects

1. Add the [`DTXSwiftUIManualPlaceholder` configuration key](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys#swiftui "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.") to your project's [`Info.plist` file](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/info-plist-file "Info.plist file stores your app identification and configuration keys. Use it to fine-tune the instrumentation configuration.") and set this key to `true`.

   ```
   <key>DTXSwiftUIManualPlaceholder</key>



   <true/>
   ```
2. Add the special `AppDelegate.m` placeholder to the main class.
3. Add the `[Dynatrace handoverInstrumentorConfig:@{kDTXSwiftMappingJson: @"_DYNATRACE_SWIFTUI_MAPPING_PLACEHOLDER_"}];` line to the main class in either the `init` or the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method.

   During the build, the SwiftUI instrumentor replaces part of this line with the generated line number mapping.

### Enable automatic log cleanup

OneAgent for iOS version 8.257+

After each build, the SwiftUI instrumentor creates backups of the instrumented files and generated logs, which are stored under `dynatrace_instrumented`. By default, these files are not deleted, and the total size of the directory will grow over time. For this reason, we recommend that you to enable the automatic log cleanup.

* To delete the SwiftUI instrumentor logs after a certain number of builds, add the [`DTXCleanSwiftUILogsByCount` configuration key](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys#swiftui "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.") to your project's [`Info.plist` file](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/info-plist-file "Info.plist file stores your app identification and configuration keys. Use it to fine-tune the instrumentation configuration.").

  ```
  <key>DTXCleanSwiftUILogsByCount</key>



  <number>10</number>
  ```
* To delete the logs after a certain number of days, add the [`DTXCleanSwiftUILogsByAgeDays` configuration key](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys#swiftui "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.") to the `Info.plist` file.

  ```
  <key>DTXCleanSwiftUILogsByAgeDays</key>



  <number>5</number>
  ```

If you add both keys to the `Info.plist` file, the `DTXCleanSwiftUILogsByAgeDays` key takes precedence.

## Troubleshooting

We're still working on improving the SwiftUI instrumentation process. If you face any issues while instrumenting SwiftUI controls, refer to [Mobile applications: Issues with SwiftUI instrumentationï»¿](https://dt-url.net/yh638kl) in the Dynatrace Community.

# OneAgent for iOS auto-instrumentation features

# OneAgent for iOS auto-instrumentation features

* Explanation
* 4-min read
* Updated on Feb 03, 2026

Auto-instrumentation with OneAgent for iOS occurs during runtime. The resulting application is instrumented to the levels configured in the application's [`Info.plist` file](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/info-plist-file "Info.plist file stores your app identification and configuration keys. Use it to fine-tune the instrumentation configuration.").

The following features are automatically instrumented when you [set up OneAgent](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/dynatrace-auto-instrumentation-for-ios "Set up user experience monitoring for iOS apps within Dynatrace.") for your project. These features are enabled by default, but you can disable or configure them by adding [configuration keys](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.") to your application's `Info.plist` file.

Use auto-instrumentation in combination with [manual instrumentation](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/oneagent-sdk-for-ios "Enrich mobile user experience monitoring using OneAgent SDK for iOS.") to capture additional data. For example, you might want to manually instrument certain actions, report values, or tag specific users.

## Automatic OneAgent startup

OneAgent for iOS is initialized automatically at library load timeâthis is when the binary for the OneAgent library is loaded into a mobile application at application startup. This happens before `applicationWillFinishLaunching`, where OneAgent can be started manually.

Set the [`DTXAutoStart` configuration key](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys#general "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.") to `false` to disable automatic OneAgent startup. In that case, you'll need to [start OneAgent manually](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/oneagent-sdk-for-ios#start-oneagent "Enrich mobile user experience monitoring using OneAgent SDK for iOS.").

## Lifecycle monitoring

OneAgent collects data on the following events.

* `AppStart` (application start event)

  + Automatic OneAgent startup: Measures the timespan from when OneAgent starts to when the [`application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`ï»¿](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1622921-application) method is called.
  + Manual OneAgent startup: Measures the timespan from when the [OneAgent manual startup API](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/oneagent-sdk-for-ios#start-oneagent "Enrich mobile user experience monitoring using OneAgent SDK for iOS.") is called to when the `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method is called. When the manual startup API is called after `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`, the `AppStart` event is not generated.
* `Display`: Measures the timespan from loading a view to when the view appears on the screen. Timestamps of the `viewDidLoad`, `viewWillAppear`, and `viewDidAppear` calls of the `ViewController` classes are displayed in the user action waterfall analysis and are marked as a **Lifecycle event**.
* `Redisplay`: Measures the timespan from loading a view to when the view reappears on the screen. Timestamps of the `viewWillAppear` and `viewDidAppear` calls of the `ViewController` classes are displayed in the user action waterfall analysis and are marked as a **Lifecycle event**.

Set the [`DTXInstrumentLifecycleMonitoring` configuration key](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys#lifecycle-monitoring "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.") to `false` to disable automatic lifecycle monitoring. Also, check other keys in the [**Lifecycle monitoring**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys#lifecycle-monitoring "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.") section for more configuration options.

To learn which lifecycle events are reported for SwiftUI, see [Instrument SwiftUI controls | Lifecycle monitoring](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/instrument-swiftui-controls#lifecycle "Use the Dynatrace SwiftUI instrumentor to monitor your SwiftUI apps.").

## Crash reporting

OneAgent captures all unhandled exceptions and sends the [crash](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#crash "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace.") report to the server. The crash report includes the occurrence time and the full stack trace of the exception.

The crash details are sent only when the user reopens the mobile application (so on the next application launch). However, if the user doesn't open the application within 10 minutes, the crash report is deleted. This is because Dynatrace doesn't send crash reports that are older than 10 minutes (as such reports can no longer be correlated on the Dynatrace Cluster).

Set the [`DTXCrashReportingEnabled` configuration key](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys#privacy-and-security "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.") to `false` to disable crash reporting.

## Web request monitoring

OneAgent automatically instruments and tags your web requests. To track web requests, OneAgent adds the `x-dynatrace` HTTP header with a unique value to the web request. This is required to correlate the server-side monitoring data to the corresponding mobile web request.

Set the [`DTXInstrumentWebRequestTiming` configuration key](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys#web-requests "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.") to `false` to disable web request monitoring. Also, check other keys in the [**Web requests**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys#web-requests "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.") section to configure web request timing and tagging.

To learn how to manually instrument web requests, see [Measure web requests](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/oneagent-sdk-for-ios#measure-web-requests "Enrich mobile user experience monitoring using OneAgent SDK for iOS.").

## Web request monitoring for requests passed to `WKWebView`

OneAgent automatically instruments and tags web requests that are passed to `WKWebView`.

Note that OneAgent does not monitor requests issued inside `WKWebView`. Such requests are handled by the [RUM JavaScript](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/customize-rum "Find out how to customize Real User Monitoring using the JavaScript API.") if you've properly configured your [hybrid application monitoring](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-hybrid-app "Learn how you can instrument various types of hybrid and cross-platform mobile apps.") with Dynatrace.

Set the [`DTXInstrumentWebViewTiming` configuration key](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys#hybrid "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.") to `false` to disable automatic web request timing and tagging for requests passed to `WKWebView`.

## User action detection

OneAgent detects and times user actions such as button taps, view actions, and other UI control interactions. OneAgent creates user actions based on the UI components that trigger these actions and automatically combines user action data with other monitoring data, such as information on web requests and crashes. OneAgent extends the lifetime of user actions to properly aggregate them with other events that are executed in a background thread or immediately after a user action.

Set the [`DTXInstrumentAutoUserAction` configuration key](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys#user-actions "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.") to `false` to disable automatic creation of user actions. Also, check other configuration keys in the [**User actions**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys#user-actions "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.") section to control user action detection.

Using OneAgent for iOS, you can also perform the following actions related to user actions.

* [Create custom actions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/oneagent-sdk-for-ios#create-custom-user-action "Enrich mobile user experience monitoring using OneAgent SDK for iOS.")
* [Cancel custom and autogenerated user action](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/oneagent-sdk-for-ios#cancel-action "Enrich mobile user experience monitoring using OneAgent SDK for iOS.")
* [Use custom control titles](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/oneagent-sdk-for-ios#custom-control-names "Enrich mobile user experience monitoring using OneAgent SDK for iOS.")
* [Modify autogenerated actions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/oneagent-sdk-for-ios#modify-auto-actions "Enrich mobile user experience monitoring using OneAgent SDK for iOS.")
* [Mask user actions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/oneagent-sdk-for-ios#mask-user-actions "Enrich mobile user experience monitoring using OneAgent SDK for iOS.")

To learn how OneAgent constructs user action names, see [User action naming](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/oneagent-sdk-for-ios#user-action-naming "Enrich mobile user experience monitoring using OneAgent SDK for iOS.").

## Rage tap detection

When your mobile application doesn't respond quickly or there's a user interface issue, your users might repeatedly tap the screen or affected UI control. OneAgent detects such behavior as a [rage tap](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#rage-event "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace.").

Set the [`DTXDetectRageTaps` configuration key](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys#user-actions "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.") to `false` to stop detecting rage taps.

## Location monitoring

ð´ Disabled by default

OneAgent can capture the location of your application's end users and send the captured location as a metric to the server. To protect the privacy of your users, OneAgent captures GPS coordinates with a precision of two decimal places (~1 km accuracy).

Set the [`DTXInstrumentGPSLocation` configuration key](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys#privacy-and-security "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.") to `true` to enable location capturing.

# Instrument iOS apps

# Instrument iOS apps

* Overview
* 1-min read
* Updated on Feb 09, 2026

The process of monitoring the user experience of your native mobile apps is fundamentally different from monitoring browser-based web applications. This is because mobile-app monitoring involves the compilation, packaging, and shipment of a monitoring library along with your own mobile application package.

To monitor your mobile app with Dynatrace, you'll need to instrument OneAgent for iOS, which provides visibility into activity lifecycle, user actions, web requests, crashes, and more.

Explore our new [demo mobile applicationï»¿](https://dt-url.net/332226v) to get a feel of how the instrumentation with Dynatrace works. This sample application showcases the main features provided by the OneAgent SDK for iOS.

For the supported iOS versions, check [Technology support | Mobile app Real User Monitoring](/docs/ingest-from/technology-support#mobile-rum "Find technical details related to Dynatrace support for specific platforms and development frameworks.").

### Instrumentation

* [Set up OneAgent for your iOS apps](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/dynatrace-auto-instrumentation-for-ios "Set up user experience monitoring for iOS apps within Dynatrace.")
* [Instrument SwiftUI controls](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/instrument-swiftui-controls "Use the Dynatrace SwiftUI instrumentor to monitor your SwiftUI apps.")
* [OneAgent for iOS auto-instrumentation features](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/ios-auto-instrumentation-features "Explore the list of features that are available after you instrument your application with OneAgent.")
* [Info.plist file](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/info-plist-file "Info.plist file stores your app identification and configuration keys. Use it to fine-tune the instrumentation configuration.")

### Customization

* [OneAgent for iOS advanced configuration](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/configuration-settings "Configure auto-instrumentation for iOS apps using advanced settings.")
* [OneAgent for iOS configuration keys](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.")
* [OneAgent SDK for iOS](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/oneagent-sdk-for-ios "Enrich mobile user experience monitoring using OneAgent SDK for iOS.")
* [OneAgent for iOS debug logging](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/logging-for-ios "Turn on debug logging for OneAgent.")

### Data privacy

[Configure data privacy settings for mobile applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.")

[User privacy for iOS](/docs/manage/data-privacy-and-security/data-privacy/user-privacy-for-ios "Learn about what kind of data OneAgent collects when you need to report your app privacy to Apple.")

Starting with OneAgent for iOS version 8.335, Dynatrace stopped supporting Xcode 16. We only support Xcode 26+.

Also, be aware that [Apple's App Store submission guidelinesï»¿](https://dt-url.net/we038fb) will restrict support to applications built with a minimum of Xcode 26 around April 2026.

Starting with OneAgent for iOS version 8.323, Dynatrace will stop supporting `static builds` and `Carthage` as integration methods.

We recommend migrating to a supported alternative like Swift Package Manager to ensure continued compatibility and updates.

OneAgent for iOS version 8.249 is the last version that supports the 32-bit architecture.

# Data model of the New RUM Experience

# Data model of the New RUM Experience

* Latest Dynatrace
* Explanation
* Updated on Jan 07, 2026

The New RUM Experience provides deep visibility into how end users interact with the frontends of your applications. It delivers insights into user behavior and experience, along with performance metrics and error details. This page outlines the underlying data model and how the captured data is organized in Grail.

![New RUM Experience data model](https://dt-cdn.net/images/data-model-2264-a2dd12ab3d.png)

## User Events

In the New RUM Experience, all end-user data is captured as **user events**, which are stored in the `user.events` table. For details, see [User events](/docs/semantic-dictionary/model/rum/user-events "User events provide deep visibility and insights into experience, behavior, performance, and errors of your customers and end-users in real-time.") in the Semantic Dictionary.

Each event includes the following attributes:

* Basic attributes such as an ID, start and end time, and duration.
* Contextual details such as operating system, geolocation, device, and browser.
* At least one characteristic that describes the event's natureâfor example, navigations, errors, requests, or user interactions.
* Attributes specific to the event's characteristics.

The following sections outline some important user event characteristics.

### Page summaries, view summaries, and navigations

The concept of **pages** applies only to web frontends, where it represents an HTML page loaded through a full page load.

**Views**, on the other hand, refer to the content displayed to the user at any time. Views are supported on both web and mobile frontends:

* On web, unlike pages, switching to a new view does not require a full page load.
* On mobile, a view represents a specific screen presented to the user.

Data collected for a page or viewâsuch as performance metrics and error countsâis aggregated in [page summary](/docs/semantic-dictionary/model/rum/user-events/navigation-related#page-summary) or [view summary](/docs/semantic-dictionary/model/rum/user-events/navigation-related#view-summary) events.

[Navigations](/docs/semantic-dictionary/model/rum/user-events/navigation-related#navigation) describe the transitions from one view to another or from one page to another.

To learn more about pages, views, and navigations in web frontends, see [Pages, views, and navigations in the New RUM Experience](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/concepts/pages-views-and-navigations "Understand how pages, views, and navigations are defined for web frontends the New RUM Experience.").

### User interactions

Early Access

**User interactions** represent activities performed by an end user on the application's frontend. Capturing them can be enabled as described in [User interactions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/user-interactions "Learn how to capture and analyze user interactions."). The specific types of interactions depend on the frontend technology:

* For web applications, this includes events such as clicks, scrolls, hover, and mouseover.
* For mobile applications, it includes mobile touches.

For a complete list of user interactions, see [User interactions](/docs/semantic-dictionary/model/rum/user-events/user-interactions) in the Semantic Dictionary.

In RUM Classic, user interactions were only recorded when they were part of a user action involving a request. In the New RUM Experience, this restriction does not applyâinteractions can be captured independently of any request.

### User actions

A user action represents a significant operation within the frontend and its implications, such as:

* a click followed by an XHR request
* a soft navigation followed by DOM mutations

Currently, user actions are only available for web frontends. For details, see [User actions in web frontends](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/concepts/user-actions "Learn about the user action concept for web frontends in the New RUM Experience.").

### Requests

[Request events](/docs/semantic-dictionary/model/rum/user-events/requests) capture requests issued by the browser or mobile app, such as HTTP calls. They include details like the URL, HTTP method, and status code for HTTP requests, along with performance metricsâfor example, values from the [W3C Resource Timingï»¿](https://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing/) and [W3C Navigation Timingï»¿](https://www.w3.org/TR/navigation-timing-2/) APIs in web frontends.

### Errors

The New RUM Experience captures a wide range of error types, including:

* Failed requests
* Uncaught exceptions
* CSP violations in web frontends
* Crashes in mobile frontends
* Application Not Responding (ANR) errors in mobile frontends

For the full specification of errors, see [Semantic DictionaryâGlobal field referenceâError](/docs/semantic-dictionary/fields#error "Get to know the list of global fields that have a well defined semantic meaning in Dynatrace and can be used across different monitoring types.").

## User sessions

**User sessions** summarize all user events from the same end user within a limited time frame. A session ends after a period of inactivity or when the maximum session duration is reached. User sessions are stored in the `user.sessions` table.

Unlike RUM Classic, there is no limit on the number of user actions per session.

You can add a **user identifier** to each session via the [RUM JavaScript APIï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/doc/javascriptapi/doc-latest/functions/Types.dynatrace.identifyUser.html) or the [mobile RUM APIs](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/mobile-frontends/new-rum-apis "Explore the new Real User Monitoring (RUM) APIs for mobile frontends, including startup configuration, event reporting, error handling, view tracking, and advanced features for Dynatrace on Grail.") to facilitate analysis based on user context. If your code already calls the RUM Classic API to identify a user, this call is also effective for the New RUM Experience.

For the full specification of user sessions, see [User sessions](/docs/semantic-dictionary/model/rum/user-sessions "User sessions provide a summary of the user events from the same customer or end-user of your application during a limited period of time.") in the Semantic Dictionary.

## Event and session properties

**Event and session properties** are custom key-value pairs you can define to enrich captured user events and sessions. These properties enable, for example, powerful queries, filtering, and the creation of custom metrics.

To learn how to add event and session properties, see [Capture event and session properties for web frontends](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/additional-configuration/event-and-session-properties "Learn how to capture event and session properties for web frontends.") and [Capture event and session properties for mobile frontends](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/mobile-frontends/additional-configuration/event-and-session-properties "Learn how to capture event and session properties for mobile frontends.").

# Data privacy in the New RUM Experience

# Data privacy in the New RUM Experience

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Published Jan 15, 2026

The New RUM Experience provides comprehensive data privacy settings designed to help your organization protect end-user personal data and maintain compliance with data protection regulations. While Dynatrace offers these tools, itâs your responsibility to apply them effectively to safeguard your users' information.

## Best Practices

To protect user data, we recommend the following best practices.

1. **Review regulatory requirements:** Ensure your privacy configuration aligns with GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable regulations.
2. **Balance privacy and observability:** Choose settings that safeguard users while maintaining monitoring effectiveness.
3. **Document your choices:** Keep clear records explaining the rationale behind enabling or disabling specific privacy options.
4. **Regular audits:** Periodically review your privacy configurations to maintain compliance.
5. **User transparency:** Communicate data collection practices through privacy policies and consent mechanisms.

## Configuration

The data privacy settings available in RUM Classic are also supported in the New RUM Experience. When you enable the New RUM Experience for an application already instrumented with RUM Classic, your existing data privacy settings are automatically applied.

For new frontends instrumented in the New RUM Experience, use the guides linked below to configure data privacy.

# Page load waterfall

# Page load waterfall

* Latest Dynatrace
* Reference
* 7-min read
* Published Jan 14, 2025

The page load waterfall in ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** provides powerful visualization and analysis capabilities for understanding web application performance at the [page instance](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/concepts/pages-views-and-navigations#pages-and-page-instances "Understand how pages, views, and navigations are defined for web frontends the New RUM Experience.") level. This feature helps you analyze individual page loads, identify performance bottlenecks, and optimize the user experience by examining resource loading patterns and timing metrics.

![Example page load waterfall](https://dt-cdn.net/images/rum-page-load-waterfall-1915-f8def7fc9c.png)

## Access waterfall analysis

To access the page load waterfall

1. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals**.
2. Select a web frontend in the **Explorer** view and select **Analyze performance**, or directly select a frontend in the **Performance** view.
3. Navigate to the **Pages** section and drill down into a specific page.
4. Select  **Perform waterfall analysis**.

## Page load instances table

The **Page load instances** table displays a list of individual page loads captured during the selected timeframe containing some metadata, counts, and metrics.

Available columns:

* Start time: The timestamp when the page load began
* Country
* Browser and browser version
* Errors: The number of errors encountered during the whole page instance (not only the page load)
* Long tasks: The count of long tasks that may have blocked the main thread during the whole page instance (not only the page load)
* Core Web Vitals and W3C navigation timings of the page

## Waterfall visualization

When you select a page load instance, the waterfall panel opens. In the waterfall you see each individual request of the page load instance with its type, name, timings, metadata, and the Gantt chart with the instance timing metric annotations and individual phases.

Clicking on any request in the waterfall reveals detailed information about the request and further drill down options. When hovering over the gantt chart entries you see the phase details.

Use cases

Drill-downs

### Identify slow resources

Use the waterfall to identify resources that are taking too long to load:

* Sort page instances by duration or specific metrics like TTFB or LCP
* Select instances with poor performance
* Examine the waterfall to find the resources contributing to slow load times
* Look for resources with long response times or render-blocking behavior

### Compare performance across conditions

Filter page load instances by:

* **Browser type and version**: Identify browser-specific performance issues
* **Geographic location**: Understand performance variations by region
* **Error conditions**: Compare successful loads with failed loads
* **Time periods**: Analyze performance trends over time

* **Session details**: Open the full session in the add-on provided by ![Users & Sessions](https://dt-cdn.net/images/users-sessions-149-f84e0b9b20.png "Users & Sessions") **Users & Sessions** to see the page load in the context of the entire user journey.
* **Request trace linking**: Access detailed trace information for server-side performance analysis in the ![Distributed Tracing](https://dt-cdn.net/images/distributed-tracing-4ed13d1274.svg "Distributed Tracing") **Distributed Tracing**.
* **Error analysis**: For failed requests you can dig deeper in the ![Error Inspector](https://dt-cdn.net/images/error-inspector-256-c849b18430.png "Error Inspector") **Error Inspector**.
* **Resource ready-mades**: For individual requests you can drill down into a provided ready-made dashboard. This enables you to dig deeper into single resources.
* **Query**: Open the waterfall query in ![Notebooks](https://dt-cdn.net/images/notebooks-768-046137830a.webp "Notebooks") **Notebooks** for advanced queries and custom analysis using DQL.

# Capture event and session properties for mobile frontends

# Capture event and session properties for mobile frontends

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Updated on Jan 22, 2026

Event and session properties let you attach custom-defined key-value pairs to user events and user sessions, using the namespaces [`event_properties`](/docs/semantic-dictionary/model/rum/user-events#event-properties "User events provide deep visibility and insights into experience, behavior, performance, and errors of your customers and end-users in real-time.") and [`session_properties`](/docs/semantic-dictionary/model/rum/user-sessions#user-session-properties "User sessions provide a summary of the user events from the same customer or end-user of your application during a limited period of time.").

## Before you start sending event or session properties

Event and session properties must be configured before they can be used. Incoming event and session properties that are not configured are dropped during event ingest.

To define a new property

1. In ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals**, select the frontend for which you want to add the property.
2. Select the **Settings** tab, then choose **Event and session properties**.
3. Select **Add** under either **Defined event properties** or **Defined session properties**, depending on the type of property you want to create.
4. In the **Field name** box, enter a name for your property (for example, `cart.total_value`).
5. Optional To make the field name case-insensitive, turn on **Field name validation should be case-insensitive**.
6. From the **Datatype** list, select the appropriate data type for your property: `string`, `boolean`, or `number`.

Dynatrace automatically prefixes your field name with `event_properties.` or `session_properties.` based on the property type you selected. For example, a field name of `cart.total_value` will become `event_properties.cart.total_value`.

## How to send properties

Event and session properties can be sent via the [New RUM APIs](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/mobile-frontends/new-rum-apis "Explore the new Real User Monitoring (RUM) APIs for mobile frontends, including startup configuration, event reporting, error handling, view tracking, and advanced features for Dynatrace on Grail."):

* To add event properties, use [`addEventModifier`](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/mobile-frontends/new-rum-apis#add-event-modifier "Explore the new Real User Monitoring (RUM) APIs for mobile frontends, including startup configuration, event reporting, error handling, view tracking, and advanced features for Dynatrace on Grail.").
* To send a session property, use [`sendSessionPropertyEvent`](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/mobile-frontends/new-rum-apis#send-session-property-event "Explore the new Real User Monitoring (RUM) APIs for mobile frontends, including startup configuration, event reporting, error handling, view tracking, and advanced features for Dynatrace on Grail.").

## Limits

* Naming

  + Field name maximum length: 100 characters (including the `event_properties.` / `session_properties.` prefix).
  + Allowed characters in field name: AâZ, aâz, 0â9, underscore `_`, and dot `.`.
  + Each dot must be followed by an alphabetic character.
  + Each underscore must be followed by an alphabetic character or number.
* Countsâa maximum of 20 event and session properties can be configured.
* Values

  + Values must be primitive types (`String`, `Int`, `Long`, `Double`, `Boolean`).
  + For event and session properties of data type `String`, the length is limited to 1,000 characters.

Valid examples:

* `event_properties.purchase_state`
* `event_properties.cart.total_value`
* `session_properties.product_tier`
* `session_properties.loyalty_status`

# Configure data privacy settings for mobile frontends

# Configure data privacy settings for mobile frontends

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Published Jan 12, 2026

For many companies, ensuring the privacy of their customers' personal data is an important component of the digital business success. Dynatrace provides numerous privacy enhancements that you can use to configure the data privacy settings of your apps. When you properly set up these settings, this helps to protect your customers' personal data and to ensure your organization's compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), data disclosure requirements of app stores, and other data protection laws and regulations.

While Dynatrace offers numerous data privacy settings configurable both on the [environment](/docs/manage/data-privacy-and-security/configuration/configure-global-privacy-settings "Learn how to set up data privacy masking for end user IP addresses, geolocations, and user action names.") and application levels, it's only your responsibility to properly set up these settings and take precautions that protect your customers' personal data.

## User opt-in mode

With opt-in mode, each user of your application can set their data privacy preferences and decide whether they want or don't want to share their information. They can choose exactly what types of information they are willing to share. For example, one user might allow you only to report crashes, while the other might permit you also to capture performance and user data.

### Possible flow for user opt-in mode

The following steps describe the standard workflow for setting up the user opt-in mode for your mobile applications.

1. You [enable user opt-in mode](#enable-opt-in-mode) via a special flag or key and re-instrument your application.
2. At startup, OneAgent checks whether a user has already configured their data privacy preferences.

   By default, the following default data privacy preferences are used for all users who haven't yet set their data privacy preferences:

   * Data collection level: `Off` (monitoring data is not sent to Dynatrace)
   * Crash reporting: `Off` (crash reports are not sent to Dynatrace)

   Thanks to that, upon the first launch of your app, no data is shared with Dynatrace.
3. If the user hasn't configured their data privacy preferences, you show a dialog (see example below) asking for the user's permission to capture the performance data (corresponds to the **Performance** [data collection level](#data-collection-levels)), include their personal data in the information reported to Dynatrace (corresponds to the **User behavior** data collection level), and report crashes.

   Donât forget to create and show users the dialog with the data privacy settings. The users of your application will use this dialog to set their data privacy settings.
4. The user sets their data privacy preferences; you use the API calls to store the user's data privacy preferences.
5. Upon the next startup of your application, OneAgent applies the new data privacy preferences and reports only as much data as the particular user has agreed to share with Dynatrace.

![User opt in mode mobile](https://dt-cdn.net/images/gdpr-mobile-1-1221-621bb17f17.png)

### Enable opt-in mode

To activate the opt-in mode for mobile applications

1. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** > **Overview**.
2. Select  **Mobile** to view all mobile frontends.
3. Select the frontend you want to configure.
4. On the **Settings** tab, select **Data privacy**.
5. Turn on **Enable user opt-in mode**.
6. Update your application's configuration file (build file for Android, [`Info.plist`](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/info-plist-file "Info.plist file stores your app identification and configuration keys. Use it to fine-tune the instrumentation configuration.") for iOS, and `dynatrace.config.<extension>` for cross-platform frameworks) by adding a special flag or key that enables opt-in mode.

   Check the instrumentation wizard for the updated configuration code snippet.
7. Rebuild your application so that the new configuration takes effect.

Check the sections below for detailed instructions on how to set up the mobile user opt-in mode for your applications.

[Android SDK](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-oneagent-sdk/oneagent-sdk-for-android#data-privacy) [iOS SDK](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/oneagent-sdk-for-ios#privacy) [Cordova](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dynatrace/cordova-plugin#user-privacy-options) [Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/dynatrace_flutter_plugin#useroptin) [React Native](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dynatrace/react-native-plugin#user-opt-in-mode) [Xamarin](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/cross-platform-frameworks/xamarin-nuget#useroptin) [![.NET MAUI](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dotnetmaui-aea483621e.svg ".NET MAUI").NET MAUI](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/cross-platform-frameworks/maui#useroptin) 

### Data collection levels

The table below describes the available data collection levels and shows whether [user tags](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#user-tagging "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace.") and custom user actions, events, values, and errors are reported for a particular level.

![Applicable](https://dt-cdn.net/images/icon-green-check-700-c9ea81e533.svg "Applicable")

1

A single `Loading <App>` event is sent to track the number of users that opted out.

2

If you haven't configured user tagging and custom event or value reporting, the **User behavior** level works similarly to the **Performance** level.

## User tracking

OneAgent for Mobile uses the `x-dynatrace` header for tagging HTTP requests. Dynatrace uses this header to link the mobile part of the web request to the service part captured by another OneAgent.

For hybrid applications, the `dtAdk` cookie allows to join a session from OneAgent for Mobile and a session from the RUM JavaScript so that these sessions appear as a single session, while the `dtAdkSettings` cookie is used for syncing settings between OneAgent for Mobile and the RUM JavaScript.

## User action masking

If you want to avoid capturing personal information for all user actions in your mobile app, check the related sections on user action masking for [Android](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/monitoring-capabilities#mask-user-actions "Configure the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin to adjust the monitoring capabilities of OneAgent.") or [iOS](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/oneagent-sdk-for-ios#mask-user-actions "Enrich mobile user experience monitoring using OneAgent SDK for iOS.").

After you enable user action masking for your mobile app, OneAgent replaces all `Touch on <control title>` action names with the class name or type of the control that the user touched. For example, `Touch on Account 123456` is changed to `Touch on Button`.

## Data privacy questionnaire in app stores

To learn what data OneAgent captures and complete the data privacy questionnaire in Google Play Console or App Store Connect, see the following pages:

* [Data safety guidance for Android](/docs/manage/data-privacy-and-security/data-privacy/user-privacy-for-android "Information on types of data that OneAgent for Android collects. You can use this page when filling out the Data safety form in Google Play Console.")
* [User privacy for iOS](/docs/manage/data-privacy-and-security/data-privacy/user-privacy-for-ios "Learn about what kind of data OneAgent collects when you need to report your app privacy to Apple.")

# Relationship between the New RUM Experience and RUM Classic

# Relationship between the New RUM Experience and RUM Classic

* Latest Dynatrace
* Explanation
* 1-min read
* Updated on Jan 23, 2026

The New RUM Experience currently relies on certain RUM Classic functionalities. Hereâs what this means for you.

#### Enabling the New RUM Experience

You can currently enable the New RUM Experience only if RUM Classic is active. At this time, disabling data ingestion into RUM Classic and fully migrating is not possible.

#### Configuration

Most configuration settings for the New RUM Experience are based on those already used by RUM Classic. This means that:

* Changes made in the New RUM Experience also apply to RUM Classic.
* Conversely, if you modify settings in RUM Classic that are also available in the New RUM Experience, those changes will apply there as well.

Event and session properties are an exceptionâthey have a separate configuration from user action and session properties in RUM Classic.

#### Monitoring traffic

When the New RUM Experience is enabled, RUM beacons in a new format are sent alongside RUM Classic beacons to the same endpoint.

#### Infrastructure requirements

At this point, the New RUM Experience relies only on the HTTP headers and cookies already covered by the [firewall constraints for RUM Classic](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/firewall-constraints-for-rum "Find out how to make sure that Real User Monitoring data passes through your firewall."). If your firewalls and other infrastructure components are already configured to let these headers and cookies pass through, no further changes are required when you enable the New RUM Experience.

OpenPipeline makes it straightforward to turn [user events](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/concepts/data-model#user-events "Get familiar with the data model at the heart of the New RUM Experience.") into custom metrics, giving you the power to analyze patterns that impact your goals in [![Notebooks](https://dt-cdn.net/images/notebooks-768-046137830a.webp "Notebooks") **Notebooks**](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/dashboards-and-notebooks/notebooks "Analyze, visualize, and share insights from your observability dataâall in one collaborative, customizable workspace.") and [![Dashboards](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-512-b1f1e9690b.png "Dashboards") **Dashboards**](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/dashboards-and-notebooks/dashboards-new "Create interactive, customizable views to visualize, analyze, and share your observability data in real time.") while ensuring your data remains useful for long-term analysis. Its ability to parse data from standard user event attributes into dedicated fields facilitates metric extraction.

To illustrate the process, this guide uses a travel booking site as an exampleâthe number of views per journey is extracted into a custom metric to help identify trends.

## Example scenario

In this tutorial, weâll use the [Dynatrace demo application easyTravelï»¿](https://dt-url.net/rj034fg) as an example. easyTravel lists available journeys, and when a user selects a journey, its details are displayed.

The application is instrumented with the RUM JavaScript, and the captured data is mapped to a [frontend](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/concepts/frontends "Learn about the frontend concept in the New RUM Experience.") named `easytravel`. Each time a user navigates from one page to anotherâfor example, from the home page to a specific journeyâa [navigation event](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/concepts/pages-views-and-navigations#navigations "Understand how pages, views, and navigations are defined for web frontends the New RUM Experience.") is captured.

Navigation events provide the information needed to analyze the number of views per journey. Each journey has a unique ID. When a soft navigation to a specific journey occurs, the URL path updates to include that journey IDâfor example, `/easytravel/journeys/24859438`. This value is captured in the `view.url.path` field of the navigation event.

Therefore, you can analyze the number of views per journey by running the following DQL query:

```
fetch user.events



| filter matchesPhrase(frontend.name, "easytravel") AND



characteristics.has_navigation == true AND



matchesPhrase(view.url.path, "/easytravel/journeys/*") AND



not matchesPhrase(view.url.path, "*book")



| parse view.url.path, "'/'LD'/'LD'/'LD:journey_id"



| summarize by: {journey_id}, count()



| sort `count()` desc
```

While this query works well for short-term analysis, itâs not ideal for monitoring long-term trends. For that purpose, creating a custom metric derived from the query using OpenPipeline is a more suitable approach.

## Before you begin

Prior knowledge

* [Dynatrace Query Language](/docs/platform/grail/dynatrace-query-language "How to use Dynatrace Query Language.")
* [Processing in OpenPipeline](/docs/platform/openpipeline/concepts/processing "Learn the core concepts of Dynatrace OpenPipeline processing.")

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the permissions described in [New RUM Experience permissions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/permissions "See what permissions you need to set up the New RUM Experience.").

## How-to

1. Create a pipeline for parsing and metric extraction

1. Go to ![Settings](https://dt-cdn.net/images/settings-icon-256-38e1321b51.webp "Settings") **Settings** > **Process and contextualize** > **OpenPipeline** > **User events** > **Pipelines**.
2. To create a new pipeline, select ![Add](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-app-menu-plus-7e9b7c3547.svg "Add") **Pipeline** and enter a name (for example, `easyTravel`).
3. To configure the parsing of the journey ID into a separate field, go to **Processing** > ![Add](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-app-menu-plus-7e9b7c3547.svg "Add") **Processor** > **DQL** and define the processor by entering:

   * A descriptive name (for example, `Add journey_id`).
   * A matching condition. In our example, the matching condition is:

     ```
     characteristics.has_navigation == true AND



     matchesPhrase(view.url.path, "/easytravel/journeys/*") AND



     not matchesPhrase(view.url.path, "*book")
     ```
   * A processor definition. In our example, the processor definition is:

     ```
     parse view.url.path, "'/'LD'/'LD'/'LD:journey_id"



     | fieldsAdd journey_id
     ```
4. To configure metric extraction, go to **Metric extraction** > ![Add](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-app-menu-plus-7e9b7c3547.svg "Add") **Processor** > **Counter metric** and define the processor by entering:

   * A descriptive **Name** (for example, `Viewed journeys`).
   * A **Matching condition** (`isNotNull(journey_id)`).
   * A **Metric key** (`easytravel.journey_view_count`).
   * A metric dimension. Under **Dimensions**

     1. Select **Custom**.
     2. Enter a **Field name on record** (`journey_id`).
     3. Enter a **Dimension name** (`journey_id`).
5. Select **Add dimension**.
6. Select **Save**.

2. Route data to the pipeline

1. Go to ![Settings](https://dt-cdn.net/images/settings-icon-256-38e1321b51.webp "Settings") **Settings** > **Process and contextualize** > **OpenPipeline** > **User events** > **Dynamic routing**.
2. To create a new route, select ![Add](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-app-menu-plus-7e9b7c3547.svg "Add") **Dynamic route** and specify:

   * A descriptive **Name** (for example, `easyTravel route`).
   * A **Matching condition**. In our example, the matching condition is:

     ```
     matchesValue(frontend.name, "easytravel")
     ```
   * The **Pipeline** containing the processing instructions (`easyTravel`).
3. Select **Save**.

## Conclusion

You have successfully created a pipeline to parse user events and extract a metric. You can now go to ![Notebooks](https://dt-cdn.net/images/notebooks-768-046137830a.webp "Notebooks") **Notebooks** and view it, for example using the following query:

```
timeseries count = sum(easytravel.journey_view_count), by: {journey_id}, interval: 3h



| sort arraysum(count) desc



| limit 5
```

# Extract a metric from user sessions

# Extract a metric from user sessions

* Latest Dynatrace
* Tutorial
* Published Dec 19, 2025

OpenPipeline lets you extract custom metrics from [user sessions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/concepts/data-model#user-sessions "Get familiar with the data model at the heart of the New RUM Experience."), enabling long-term analyses in ![Notebooks](https://dt-cdn.net/images/notebooks-768-046137830a.webp "Notebooks") **Notebooks** and ![Dashboards](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-512-b1f1e9690b.png "Dashboards") **Dashboards** that go far beyond standard performance monitoring. By combining these metrics with [user session properties](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/concepts/data-model#event-and-session-properties "Get familiar with the data model at the heart of the New RUM Experience."), you gain the flexibility to uncover insights that are highly tailored to your business objectives.

To illustrate this process, this guide walks you through extracting a customer conversion metric from user sessions, showing the number of sessions that resulted in a customer conversion versus those that did not.

## Example scenario

In this tutorial, weâll use a web shop as our example. The shop is instrumented with the RUM JavaScript, and the captured data is mapped to a [frontend](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/concepts/frontends "Learn about the frontend concept in the New RUM Experience.") named `webshop`.

Instrumentation was customized to send a user session property `successful_checkout` whenever a customer successfully completes the checkout process. The property was configured as described in [Capture event and session properties for web frontends](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/additional-configuration/event-and-session-properties "Learn how to capture event and session properties for web frontends.") and then sent via JavaScript API using [`sendSessionPropertyEvent`ï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/doc/javascriptapi/doc-latest/functions/Types.dynatrace.sendSessionPropertyEvent.html):

```
dynatrace.sendSessionPropertyEvent({



"session_properties.successful_checkout": true



});
```

With this setup, you can analyze the number of sessions with and without customer conversion by running the following DQL query:

```
fetch user.sessions



| summarize by:{session_properties.successful_checkout}, count()
```

While this query works well for short-term analysis, itâs not ideal for uncovering long-term patterns, which is much better handled by using a custom metric.

   * A **Matching condition** (`true`).
   * A **Metric key** (`webshop.checkout_statistics`).
   * A metric dimension Under **Dimensions**

     1. Select **Custom**.
     2. Enter a **Field name on record** (`session_properties.successful_checkout`).
     3. Enter a **Dimension name** (`successful_checkout`).
     4. Enter a **Default value** (`false`).
4. Select **Add dimension**.
5. Select **Save**.

2. Route data to the pipeline

   * A **Matching condition**. In our example, the matching condition is:

     ```
     matchesValue(frontend.name, "webshop")
     ```
   * The **Pipeline** containing the processing instructions (`Webshop`).
3. Select **Save**.

## Conclusion

You have successfully extracted a custom metric from user sessions. You can now go to ![Notebooks](https://dt-cdn.net/images/notebooks-768-046137830a.webp "Notebooks") **Notebooks** and view it, for example using the following query:

```
timeseries sum(easytravel.checkout_statistics), by: { successful_checkout }, interval: 15m



| fieldsAdd checkout_status = if(successful_checkout == "true", "Successful Checkout", else: "No Checkout")
```

# User interactions

# User interactions

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Updated on Jan 21, 2026

Early Access

The New RUM Experience allows you to capture [user interactions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/concepts/data-model#user-interactions "Get familiar with the data model at the heart of the New RUM Experience.") such as clicks and scrolls on web frontends, as well as touch events on mobile frontends.

User interactions are currently in Early Access and available for the following technologies:

* Web
* iOS native
* Android native
* SwiftUI
* Jetpack Compose

## Early Access FAQ

What is the cost of ingesting user interactions?

There are no additional charges during the User Interaction Early Access.

What is the cost of querying user interactions?

Raw DEM data queries are currently in Early Access. There are no additional charges during this period. For details, see [Calculate your consumption of Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM) - Query](/docs/license/capabilities/digital-experience-monitoring-query-retain/queries-dem "Learn how your consumption of the DEM-related DQL queries is consumed and billed before and after Early Access.").

What is the data retention period for user interactions?

Like other user events, user interactions have a [default data retention period](/docs/manage/data-privacy-and-security/data-privacy/data-retention-periods#new-rum-user-events-and-sessions "Check retention times for various data types.") of 35 days. You can extend data retention by joining the [Extended Retention for RUM & Synthetic preview](/docs/whats-new/preview-releases#extended-retention-for-rum-and-synthetic "Learn about our Preview releases and how you can participate in them.").

## Types of user interactions

The following table provides an overview of the available types of user interactions. For a detailed specification, see [User interaction](/docs/semantic-dictionary/model/rum/user-events/user-interactions) in the Semantic Dictionary.

User interaction type

Description

Frontend type

Click

When a user clicks or touches an HTML element. Note that a touch on an HTML element is captured as a click.

Web

Touch

When a user touches a mobile component.

Mobile

Key press

When a user presses a key combination involving the `Ctrl`, `Alt`, or `Meta` (`Windows` or `Cmd`) keys, or presses one of the individual keys `Esc`, `Enter`, `Tab`, and `Space`.

Web

Zoom/Resize

When a user zooms in or out, or resizes the viewport.

Web

Focus/Blur

When a user focuses on or leaves an HTML element. This interaction is only captured if the `data-dt-focus` or `data-dt-blur` attributes, respectively, are present on the HTML element.

Web

Change

When a user modifies a value in a form field, for example, by selecting a checkbox.

Web

Scroll

When a user scrolls through a page or view.

Web

Drag/Drop

When a user starts or ends a drag operation. Valid external drop actions are also captured, for example, dropping a file into an upload area. In both cases, the position is recorded.

Web

Mouseover

When a user hovers over an HTML element. This interaction is only captured if the `data-dt-mouse-over=<ms>` attribute is present on the HTML element.

Web

## Activate capturing of user interactions

To capture user interactions for a web or mobile frontend

1. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** > **Overview**.
2. Select  **Frontends** to view all frontends.
3. Select the frontend you want to configure.
4. Switch to the **Settings** tab.
5. Under **Enablement and cost control**, turn on **User Interactions** .

## Analyze user interactions

There are two primary ways to analyze user interactions:

* The [![Users & Sessions](https://dt-cdn.net/images/users-sessions-149-f84e0b9b20.png "Users & Sessions") **Users & Sessions**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/users-and-sessions "The Users & Sessions app delivers insight into individual user journeys and behavior patterns.") app lets you view all user interactions that occurred during a user session. This is particularly helpful for customer support teams and developers who need to understand what happened when troubleshooting customer issues or bugs. After filtering sessions based on your criteria and selecting one, all related user interactions are listed and displayed in the timeline.
* User interaction analysis via DQL supports a wide range of behavioral use cases for product managers and product owners. In these scenarios, user interactions often appear alongside navigation events. For examples of how to derive behavioral insights using DQL, see [DQL examples](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/use-cases/dql-examples#behavioral-insights "Analyze and explore RUM data in depth by leveraging DQL.").

# Configure the beacon origin allowlist

# Configure the beacon origin allowlist

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Published Feb 04, 2026

To prevent untrusted origins from sending RUM data, Dynatrace provides a beacon origin allowlist. By configuring it, you restrict crossâorigin RUM beacons to only those origins you explicitly approve.

## Understanding sameâorigin and crossâorigin RUM beacons

The RUM JavaScript reports captured data to Dynatrace by sending beacons to a [beacon endpoint](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-beacon-endpoint "Learn how to configure the beacon endpoint for web frontends to meet your specific requirements."). These beacons can be either sameâorigin or crossâorigin, depending on the instrumentation method and any additional configuration.

The term [originï»¿](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Origin) refers to the protocol, host, and port of the URL. A request is considered sameâorigin when the protocol, host, and port of the page sending the request are exactly the same as those of the requested resource.

### Agentless frontends

When [agentless monitoring](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/set-up-agentless-monitoring "Learn how to set up agentless RUM for your web frontends in the New RUM Experience.") is used, RUM beacons are sent to a Cluster ActiveGate that is part of the Dynatrace SaaS infrastructure. These beacons are cross-origin.

### Auto-injected frontends

When the RUM JavaScript is [injected automatically](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/set-up-auto-injected-frontend "Learn how to set up an auto-injected web frontend in the New RUM Experience."), RUM beacons are, by default, sent back to the web or application server that hosts the frontend, where OneAgent provides a beacon endpoint. These are same-origin beacons.

You can configure alternative beacon endpoint setups where beacons are [sent to a Cluster ActiveGate](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-beacon-endpoint#auto-injected-to-saas-infrastructure "Learn how to configure the beacon endpoint for web frontends to meet your specific requirements.") or [to another instrumented web server on a different domain](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-beacon-endpoint#auto-injected-to-different-server "Learn how to configure the beacon endpoint for web frontends to meet your specific requirements."). Since these endpoints use a different domain, the beacons are cross-origin.

## Default CORS handling for beacon requests

Browsers enforce the same-origin policy, which by default allows scripts to send requests only to the same origin. To send cross-origin requests, [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)ï»¿](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS) must be used. It allows servers to specify which origins are permitted to access them. Therefore, cross-origin beacons need to be sent using CORS.

In its default CORS handling, the beacon endpoint accepts all origins by adding an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to the response. The header echoes the origin provided in the `Origin` request header. The endpoint then forwards the beacon payload to Dynatrace.

If you send cross-origin beacons to OneAgent, you must turn on the setting **Send beacon data via CORS** for the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to be added; see [Send beacons to a different web server](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-beacon-endpoint#auto-injected-to-different-server "Learn how to configure the beacon endpoint for web frontends to meet your specific requirements.").

If the permissive default doesnât align with your requirements, use the beacon origin allowlist to specify which origins are accepted.

## Add rules to the beacon origin allowlist

To specify from which origins OneAgents and Cluster ActiveGates should accept RUM beacons, add rules to the beacon origin allowlist.

As soon as you add the first rule, any frontend that doesnât match it will stop collecting RUM data unless its beacons are sent to the same origin and handled by OneAgent.

To add a beacon origin rule

1. Go to ![Settings](https://dt-cdn.net/images/settings-icon-256-38e1321b51.webp "Settings") **Settings** > **Collect and capture** > **Real User Monitoring** > **Frontend** > **Beacon origins for CORS**.
2. Select **Add item**.
3. Under **Matcher**, select **contains**, **starts with**, **ends with** or **equals**.
4. Under **Pattern**, provide a pattern that identifies the origin or origins the rule should accept. An origin consists of the protocol, host, and port; default ports are omitted.

You can add up to 20 beacon origin rules per environment.

## How the beacon origin allowlist is applied

If the beacon's origin specified in the `Origin` request header matches one of the rules in the allowlist, the beacon is accepted. The origin is copied to the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header, and a `200 OK` status code is returned. The beacon payload is forwarded to Dynatrace.

If, on the other hand, the origin doesn't match any rule in the allowlist, the beacon is rejected with a `403 Forbidden` status code and its payload is discarded.

The beacon origin allowlist isn't applied to same-origin beacons. If the allowlist is empty, the default behavior described in [Default CORS handling for beacon requests](#default-cors-handling) is applied.

# Configure data privacy settings for web frontends

# Configure data privacy settings for web frontends

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Published Jan 15, 2026

Ensuring compliance with GDPR and other data privacy regulations is essential for the success of your digital business. The New RUM Experience provides a comprehensive set of options that help you protect the privacy of your customersâ personal data when monitoring web frontends.

To access the data privacy settings for web frontends

1. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** > **Overview**.
2. Select  **Web** to view all web frontends.
3. Select the frontend you want to configure.
4. On the **Settings** tab, select **Data privacy**.

Check the sections below for the detailed description of each setting.

## Mask personal data in URIs

To access this setting, select **Data Privacy** > **General**.

ð´ Disabled by default

Dynatrace captures full URIs of requests that are sent from desktop and mobile browsers, as well as URIs of requests that are sent and received within monitored server-side processes. URIs may contain personal data, such as user names, passwords, or IDs.

When **Mask personal data in URIs** is turned on, Dynatrace detects personal dataâemail addresses, IBANs, payment card numbers, IP addresses, UUIDs, and other IDsâin URIs, headers, exception messages, and data captured for request attributes. It masks this data at storage by replacing it with the `<masked>` string. It also replaces query parameter values with the `<masked>` string. IDs and numbers must have at least 5 decimal or hexadecimal digits to be masked.

URI masking examples

Type of personal data

Example before masking

Example after masking

Email address

`https://example.com/user/john.doe@example.com/profile`

`https://example.com/user/<masked>/profile`

Query parameter value

`https://example.com?country=Austria&city=Linz`

`https://example.com?country=<masked>&city=<masked>`

Payment card number

`https://example.com/checkout?card=4111111111111111`

`https://example.com/checkout?card=<masked>`

IP address

`https://192.168.10.25/dashboard`

`https://<masked>/dashboard`

As a result, personal data appearing in URIs is masked in user events.

## Use persistent cookies for user tracking

To access this setting, select **Data Privacy** > **General**.

ð´ Disabled by default

The **Use persistent cookies for user tracking** setting allows you to enable or disable the use of persistent cookies for identifying returning users.

When turned on, the RUM JavaScript sets a persistent cookie in end-user browsers that indicates that the browser has been used previously to access your frontend. When turned off, RUM Classic is no longer able to associate sessions with the same user across browser restarts. Learn [how we store this cookie](/docs/manage/data-privacy-and-security/data-privacy/cookies#cookie-storage "Learn about first-party cookie usage in Dynatrace.").

## Data-collection and opt-in mode

To access this setting, select **Data Privacy** > **General**.

ð´ Disabled by default

To give your end users the ability to decide whether their activities should be tracked or not, enable opt-in mode.

By default, RUM automatically creates [cookies](/docs/manage/data-privacy-and-security/data-privacy/cookies#dynatrace-rum-cookies "Learn about first-party cookie usage in Dynatrace."). When **Data-collection and opt-in mode** is turned on, neither OneAgent nor the RUM JavaScript sets cookies, and the RUM JavaScript doesn't capture any data. After an end user accepts your cookie policy, you can activate RUM for that user via the [`dtrum.enable()`ï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/doc/javascriptapi/doc/types/dtrum.html#enable) JavaScript API call. Using the [`dtrum.disable()`ï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/doc/javascriptapi/doc/types/dtrum.html#disable) API call, you can implement a dialog that allows end users to stop sending monitoring data to Dynatrace even after they've previously agreed to it and `dtrum.enable()` has already been called.

Both API calls are effective for RUM Classic and the New RUM Experience, therefore the [new JavaScript API](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/new-javascript-api "Learn how to customize web frontend monitoring in the New RUM Experience using the JavaScript API.") does not provide equivalents at this point.

## Comply with "Do not Track" browser settings

To access this setting, select **Data Privacy** > **General**.

ð¢ Enabled by default

Another technique for protecting end-user privacy is the "Do Not Track" feature. When a user enables this feature, their browser adds the `DNT` HTTP request header to all outgoing web requests. This header specifies that the user prefers not to be tracked.

After you turn on **Comply with "Do Not Track" browser settings**, you can select between two options:

* **Capture anonymous user sessions for "Do Not Track"-enabled browsers**: When the `DNT` header is detected, Dynatrace captures RUM data but excludes all personal information that could lead to the identification of the user.

  + The IP address is masked.
  + In RUM Classic, no [user tag](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#user-tagging "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace.") information is sent.
  + In the New RUM Experience, no [user identifier](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/concepts/data-model#user-sessions "Get familiar with the data model at the heart of the New RUM Experience.") is sent if it was added using the [RUM Classic JavaScript APIï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/doc/javascriptapi/doc/types/dtrum.html#identifyuser). Note that the user identifier will still be sent if it was added using the [new JavaScript APIï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/doc/javascriptapi/doc-latest/functions/Types.dynatrace.identifyUser.html)

  With the [**User tracking** setting](#user-tracking) enabled, Dynatrace still sets a persistent cookie to detect returning users.
* **Turn Real User Monitoring off for "Do Not Track"-enabled browsers**: When the `DNT` header is detected, Dynatrace doesn't capture any data from browsers that have the "Do Not Track" setting enabled.

If you turn off **Comply with "Do Not Track" browser settings**, Dynatrace ignores the browser's "Do Not Track" setting and the `DNT` header.

The **Comply with "Do Not Track" browser settings** â **Capture anonymous user sessions for "Do Not Track"-enabled browsers** option is enabled by default for all environments and frontends.

## Mask end-user IP addresses and GPS coordinates

To access this setting, select **Data privacy** > **IP masking**.

ð¢ Enabled by default

To determine the region from which end users access web and mobile frontends, Dynatrace captures their IP addresses. GPS coordinates are captured only for mobile frontends.

When the **Mask end-user IP addresses and GPS coordinates** option is turned on, IP addresses are masked on the [beacon endpoint](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-beacon-endpoint "Learn how to configure the beacon endpoint for web frontends to meet your specific requirements."). The last octet of monitored IPv4 addresses and the last 80 bits of IPv6 addresses are replaced with zeros. [Geolocation lookups](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/detection-of-ip-addresses-locations-and-user-agents#geolocations "Dynatrace detects IP addresses and geolocations like a city, region, and country as well as browsers, devices, and operating systems.") are performed using masked IP addresses.

# Capture event and session properties for web frontends

# Capture event and session properties for web frontends

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Updated on Jan 08, 2026

Event and session properties let you attach custom-defined key-value pairs to user events and user sessions, using the namespaces [`event_properties`](/docs/semantic-dictionary/model/rum/user-events#event-properties "User events provide deep visibility and insights into experience, behavior, performance, and errors of your customers and end-users in real-time.") and [`session_properties`](/docs/semantic-dictionary/model/rum/user-sessions#user-session-properties "User sessions provide a summary of the user events from the same customer or end-user of your application during a limited period of time.").

## Before you start sending event or session properties

Event and session properties must be configured before they can be used. Incoming event and session properties that are not configured are dropped during event ingest.

To configure an event or session property

1. In ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals**, select the frontend for which you want to add the property.
2. In the **Settings** tab, select **Event and session properties**.
3. Depending on whether you want to configure an event or session property, select **Add** under either **Defined event properties** or **Defined session properties**.
4. In **Field name**, specify a name, for example `cart.total_value`.
5. If you want field name validation to be case insensitive, turn on **Field name validation should be case-insensitive**.
6. Under **Datatype**, select one of the available typesâeither `string`, `boolean`, or `number`.

Note that the field name is always prefixed with either `event_properties.` or `session_properties.`, depending on the selected type, for example `event_properties.cart.total_value`

## How to send properties

Event and session properties can be sent via the JavaScript API:

* To add event properties, use [`addEventModifier`ï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/doc/javascriptapi/doc-latest/functions/Types.dynatrace.addEventModifier.html).
* To send a session property, use [`sendSessionPropertyEvent`ï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/doc/javascriptapi/doc-latest/functions/Types.dynatrace.sendSessionPropertyEvent.html).

## Limits

* **Naming**

  + Field name maximum length: 100 characters (including the `event_properties.` / `session_properties.` prefix).
  + Allowed characters in field name: AâZ, aâz, 0â9, underscore `_`, and dot `.`.
* **Counts**

  + Maximum of 20 event and session properties can be configured.
* **Values**

  + For event and session properties of data type string, the length is limited to 1000 characters.

# Pages, views, and navigations in the New RUM Experience

# Pages, views, and navigations in the New RUM Experience

* Latest Dynatrace
* Explanation
* Updated on Jan 08, 2026

The New RUM Experience uses the concepts of pages, views, and navigations to give you detailed visibility into your application's behavior and help you elevate performanceâwhether you're working with a traditional website or a Single Page Application (SPA).

## Pages

In the New RUM Experience, the concept of a page aligns with the browser's technical definition: It represents the document request, the displayed content, and all events that occur during its lifecycleâending with the next document request.

For a traditional website, pages let you analyze each full-page navigation. For an SPA, pages capture the initial load when the user first opens the application, while [views](#views) provide the complete picture as content changes dynamically.

### Pages and page instances

Each visit to a website generates a **page instance**. The data captured is aggregated into a [page summary event](/docs/semantic-dictionary/model/rum/user-events/navigation-related#page-summary), which is identifiable by its [`page.instance_id`](/docs/semantic-dictionary/model/rum/user-events#page-attributes "User events provide deep visibility and insights into experience, behavior, performance, and errors of your customers and end-users in real-time.").

**Pages** group all visits into one aggregated entry. To analyze the same page over all visits, page instances are grouped under `page.name`. The `page.name` attribute is designed to filter out dynamic URL parts for better grouping. It's derived from `page.detected_name`, which the RUM JavaScript bases on the URL.

The **page load** of each new page instance is captured as an event with the following three [characteristics](/docs/semantic-dictionary/model/rum/user-events#user-event-characteristics "User events provide deep visibility and insights into experience, behavior, performance, and errors of your customers and end-users in real-time."):

* `characteristics.has_request`
* `characteristics.has_navigation`
* `characteristics.has_w3c_navigation_timings`

### Google Web Vitals

[Google Web Vitalsï»¿](https://web.dev/articles/vitals) are critical for understanding the user experience on a page. These metrics are captured with every page summary event. For details, see [Web vitals attributes](/docs/semantic-dictionary/model/rum/user-events/navigation-related#page-summary-web-vitals-attributes) in the Semantic Dictionary. As Google's official Web Vitals specification is page-based, the built-in Web Vitals metrics in the New RUM Experience are based on the values in page summaries, even though Web Vitals are also captured in [view summary events](#views).

Built-in metrics for Web Vitals

Web vital

Built-in metric

Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

dt.frontend.web.page.largest\_contentful\_paint

Interaction to Next Paint (INP)

dt.frontend.web.page.interaction\_to\_next\_paint

Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

dt.frontend.web.page.cumulative\_layout\_shift

First Input Delay (FID)

dt.frontend.web.page.first\_input\_delay

Time to First Byte (TTFB)

dt.frontend.web.navigation.time\_to\_first\_byte

### Example DQL query

The following DQL query retrieves the 75th percentile for the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) Web Vital by page.

```
fetch user.events



| filter characteristics.has_page_summary



| filter isNotNull(web_vitals.largest_contentful_paint)



| summarize {



percentile(web_vitals.largest_contentful_paint, 75)



}, alias:page_LCP, by:{ page.name }



| sort page_LCP desc
```

## Views

On a traditional website, every navigation triggers a full-page load, which makes it straightforward to track individual pages and their Web Vitals, providing the data needed to optimize the site. SPAs, however, work differently. They typically involve a single initial page load and then update content dynamically without reloading the entire page. This requires a different approach to segmenting and aggregating data to optimize specific parts of the application.

The New RUM Experience automatically interprets soft navigations (also called route changes) as changes to a new view. A view refers to the content displayed and all events occurring between two navigations. This concept provides meaningful performance insights for SPAs.

### Views and view instances

Each navigation creates a new **view instance**, whether it's a soft navigation or a hard navigation involving a full-page load. The start of a new page instance always marks the start of a new view instance.

Captured data for a view instance is aggregated into a [view summary event](/docs/semantic-dictionary/model/rum/user-events/navigation-related#view-summary), identified by its [`view.instance_id`](/docs/semantic-dictionary/model/rum/user-events#view-attributes "User events provide deep visibility and insights into experience, behavior, performance, and errors of your customers and end-users in real-time.").

**Views** group all visits into a single aggregated entry. To analyze the same view across multiple visits, view instances are grouped under the `view.name`. This attribute is designed to filter out dynamic parts of the URL for better grouping. It's derived from `view.detected_name`, which the RUM JavaScript bases on the URL.

During the page's lifespan, the `view.sequence_number` attribute is incremented with every navigation to a new view.

Conceptually, if a page loads and no soft navigation occurs before the next page load, the values in the view summary event and the page summary event are identical. When one or more soft navigations occur during the lifecycle of a page instance, the values in the page and view summaries diverge.

### Example of page and view instances

The following diagram shows the page and view instances created during a website visit that involves both hard and soft navigations.

![Pages and page instances](https://dt-cdn.net/images/page-instances-4210-69ed8aa0e8.png)

* When the user visits the start page `/` of a website, the following attributes are captured:

  + `page.instance_id` is a random value that identifies this exact page instance.
  + `page.detected_name` is the name detected by the RUM JavaScript.
  + `page.name` is the name used by the Dynatrace backend to group all instances.
* When the user navigates to the products page `/products` using a hard navigation:

  + `page.instance_id` and `view.instance_id` are newly generated random values.
  + `view.sequence_number` resets to 1.
* When the user views two separate products using soft navigations:

  + The `page.instance_id` remains the same.
  + `view.sequence_number` increments with each soft navigation.
  + `view.instance_id` is newly generated for each soft navigation.
  + `view.detected_name` contains a changing ID (`12345` and `56789`).
  + `view.name` replaces this dynamic ID with `:id:` for better grouping.
* When the user navigates back to the start page `/` with a hard navigation:

  + `page.instance_id` and `view.instance_id` are newly generated random values.
  + `view.sequence_number` resets to 1.

### Google Web Vitals

The New RUM Experience doesnât just capture Web Vitals for pages, it also captures them for views within a page. This is especially important for SPAs.

For example, imagine a page that displays an image gallery. The initial view shows an overview with small thumbnails. When the user navigates to the detail view of an image, a new view starts.

* The first view summary reports the Interaction to Next Paint (INP) value for the initial page load and for clicks on the small thumbnails.
* Subsequent view summary events report the INP value for the detail views, where the user interacts with larger images.
* The page summary event reports the INP value for all clicks occurring across the navigated views.

### Example DQL query

The following query retrieves the 75th percentile for LCP by view.

```
fetch user.events



| filter characteristics.has_view_summary



| filter isNotNull(web_vitals.largest_contentful_paint)



| summarize {



percentile(web_vitals.largest_contentful_paint, 75)



}, alias:view_LCP, by:{ view.name }



| sort view_LCP desc
```

## Navigations

[Navigation events](/docs/semantic-dictionary/model/rum/user-events/navigation-related#navigation) are reported during view changes and/or page changes. How they are reported depends on whether the navigation is hard (full page load) or soft (SPA route change).

### Hard navigations

For a hard navigation or full page load, the navigation event includes the document request and has, among others, the following characteristics:

* `characteristics.has_navigation`
* `characteristics.has_w3c_navigation_timings`

These events also contain full [W3C Navigation Timingï»¿](https://www.w3.org/TR/navigation-timing-2/) data from supporting browsers.

### Soft navigations

For a soft navigation, a standalone navigation event is reported with the characteristic `characteristics.has_navigation`. It includes basic information about the navigation, such as:

* `navigation.type`, which can be `hard` or `soft`.
* Information about the previous view, such as `view.source.name` and `view.source.url.full`.
* Information about the new view, such as `view.name` and `view.url.full`.

### Example of hard and soft navigations

The diagram below illustrates how view and page summaries are reported during hard and soft navigations, along with the corresponding navigation events.

![Pages, views and navigations](https://dt-cdn.net/images/pages-views-navigations-3296-b049928613.png)

* When a new page is loaded (hard navigation), a navigation event is sent with the characteristic `has_w3c_navigation_timing`.
* When a soft navigation occurs, the view summary of the previous view and the navigation event for the new view are sent.
* When the page is left, both the view summary and the page summary are sent together.

### Example DQL query

The following DQL query retrieves the amount of hard and soft navigations.

```
fetch user.events



| filter characteristics.has_navigation



| summarize count(), by: navigation.type
```

# User actions in web frontends

# User actions in web frontends

* Latest Dynatrace
* Explanation
* Updated on Jan 08, 2026

A user action represents a significant operation within the frontend and its implications. This page explains the concept for web frontends in the New RUM Experience and how it differs from RUM Classic.

## User action types

User actions in web frontends can be grouped into three types:

* **Navigation user actions:** When a soft navigation occurs, which results in a view change, a new user action is created automatically. Navigations are usually triggered by a [user interaction](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/concepts/data-model#user-interactions "Get familiar with the data model at the heart of the New RUM Experience."), but a user interaction is not required for a user action to be created.
* **Request user actions:** If a click user interaction is followed by an XHR or fetch request, a user action is created.
* **API user actions:** You can also create user actions using [`dynatrace.userAction.create()`ï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/doc/javascriptapi/doc-latest/interfaces/Types.UserActions.html) in the JavaScript API. There are no prerequisites for triggering a user action this way.

## How user actions end

A user action ends automatically based on certain conditions, or you can close it manually via the API.

### Default end behavior

While a user action is active, the RUM JavaScript keeps track of XHR and fetch requests, DOM mutations, and resource timings to determine when the user action ends. A user action ends when one of the following conditions is met:

* The user action reaches a duration of 50 s.
* The user leaves the page.
* A new user action is created. In this case, the current user action is interrupted and associated with the new one through the `user_action.interrupted_by_instance_id` attribute.
* When all of the following conditions apply during the last 100 ms:

  + No XHR or fetch requests occurred.
  + No DOM mutations occurred.
  + No new request was added to the [W3C Resource Timing APIï»¿](https://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing/). Note that requests are only added once they have finished.

### Ending user actions via the API

You can close user actions via the API using [`UserActionTracker.finish()`ï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/doc/javascriptapi/doc-latest/interfaces/Types.UserActionTracker.html).

By default, API-created user actions follow the default end behavior. To disable auto-closing, use [`UserActionTracker.autoClose()`ï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/doc/javascriptapi/doc-latest/interfaces/Types.UserActionTracker.html#autocloseautoclose-1), or set the `autoClose` option to `false` when [creating the user actionï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/doc/javascriptapi/doc-latest/interfaces/Types.UserActions.html#create-1).

## Example

The diagram below illustrates the lifecycle of a user action, using a request user action as an example.

* The user clicks somewhere on the page.
* If an XHR or fetch request occurs within 30 ms, a new user action starts.
* As long as DOM mutations, XHR or fetch requests, or resource timings are reported within 100 ms of the previous report, the user action is extended.
* If more than 100 ms pass without any report, the user action is closed and sent.

![Example of a request user action](https://dt-cdn.net/images/request-user-action-4077-cd36eca4e6.png)

## Comparison to user actions in RUM Classic

RUM Classic also provides a user action concept, but it differs in several ways from user actions in the New RUM Experience. The table below highlights the key differences.

New RUM Experience

RUM Classic

User action triggers

Click

Click, keypress, scroll, touch, etc.

Maximum action duration

50 s

180 s

Consideration of DOM mutations for default end behavior

Considers all DOM mutations.

Considers only the visible area, and only if the [Visually complete and Speed index setting](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/how-to-use-visually-complete-and-speed-index-metrics#config-key-performmetric "Learn how to use 'Visually complete' and 'Speed index' metrics.") is enabled.

Support for asynchronous JavaScript executions

Fully supported

Only partially supported, and only if [timed action support](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/configure-dynatrace-real-user-monitoring-to-capture-xhr-actions#enable-timed-action-support "Understand why you need to activate specific JavaScript frameworks for XHR-action support and learn how to configure Real User Monitoring for XHR actions.") is enabled.

# Adapt CSP rules for the New RUM Experience

# Adapt CSP rules for the New RUM Experience

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Updated on Jan 07, 2026

[Content Security Policy (CSP)ï»¿](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP) is a web standard designed to protect applications from cross-site scripting and other code injection attacks. CSP rules are most commonly defined using the `Content-Security-Policy` response header. Alternatively, they can also be set using a `<meta>` tag placed in the `<head>` section of the HTML document.

If your application has CSP rules in place, they may block the execution of the RUM JavaScript or prevent it from sending RUM beacons to the beacon endpoint.
This page explains how to modify your CSP to ensure that RUM can operate as intended.

The use of CSP nonces and hashes is not supported for the RUM JavaScript. If you need to verify the integrity of the RUM monitoring code, we recommend using Subresource Integrity (SRI) instead. For details, see [Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) in the New RUM Experience](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/subresource-integrity "Use the Subresource Integrity (SRI) browser feature in the New RUM Experience to ensure the integrity of Real User Monitoring code.").

## Allow the loading of external monitoring code

Unless you're using the snippet format [inline code](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/snippet-formats#inline-code "Learn how to select the format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case in the New RUM Experience.") and have Session Replay Classic disabled, at least part of the monitoring code is included in your application as an external file. To ensure proper functionality, your CSP rules must allow the loading and execution of scripts from the [RUM monitoring code source](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-monitoring-code-source "Configure the Real User Monitoring code source in the New RUM Experience to meet your specific requirements.").

* For **agentless frontends**, the monitoring code is loaded from the Dynatrace CDN.
* For **automatic injection**, the monitoring code is, by default, served by the OneAgent that instruments your web or application server. However, you can configure it to load from the Dynatrace CDN instead. See [Request the monitoring code from the Dynatrace CDN](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-monitoring-code-source#request-rum-monitoring-code-from-cdn "Configure the Real User Monitoring code source in the New RUM Experience to meet your specific requirements.") for details.
* If the [RUM JavaScript is inserted manually even though your process groups are instrumented with OneAgent](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-auto-injection#manual-insertion-using-oneagent "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your frontends in the New RUM Experience."), the code source configured for automatic injection is used. The only exception is the snippet format [JavaScript tag](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/snippet-formats#js-tag "Learn how to select the format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case in the New RUM Experience."), which always loads the monitoring code from the Dynatrace CDN.

To allow the loading and execution of the monitoring code, the `script-src` directive in your CSP rules must include the `'self'` keyword if the code is served by OneAgent, and `https://js-cdn.dynatracelabs.com` if it is served from the Dynatrace CDN.

## Allow the execution of inline code

If you use the snippet format [inline code](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/snippet-formats#inline-code "Learn how to select the format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case in the New RUM Experience."), the `script-src` directive in your CSP rules must include the `'unsafe-inline'` keyword to allow the execution of the monitoring code.

## Allow sending RUM beacons

RUM beacons are sent to a beacon endpoint, with the default endpoint varying based on the frontend type:

* For **agentless frontends**, beacons are, by default, reported to a Cluster ActiveGate that is part of the Dynatrace SaaS infrastructure.
* For **auto-injected frontends**, beacons are, by default, reported to the OneAgent that instruments the web or application server where the application is hosted.

Alternative setups are described in [Configure the beacon endpoint for web frontends in the New RUM Experience](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-beacon-endpoint "Learn how to configure the beacon endpoint for web frontends to meet your specific requirements.").

To allow the RUM JavaScript to send beacons, ensure that your CSP rules include the appropriate endpoint in the `connect-src` directive.

* Use the `'self'` keyword if the beacon endpoint is the OneAgent that instruments the application.
* If you configured a OneAgent that instruments a different web server as a beacon endpoint, specify the corresponding URL.
* If the beacons are handled by a Cluster ActiveGate, use the beacon endpoint URL shown in the UI.

To find the URL for a Cluster ActiveGate

1. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** > **Overview**.
2. Select  **Web** to view all web frontends.
3. Select the frontend.
4. On the **Settings** tab, select ![Settings](https://dt-cdn.net/images/settings-icon-256-38e1321b51.webp "Settings") **Open in Settings**.
5. Go to **Collect and capture** > **Frontend** > **Beacon endpoint**.
6. Copy the URL next to **Configured beacon endpoint**.

## Allow Session Replay Classic

If you use Session Replay Classic, your CSP rules must allow the RUM JavaScript to load code as a blob. For details, see [Modify Content Security Policy for Session Replay](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-replay/configure-session-replay-web#sr-csp "Configure monitoring consumption and data privacy settings for Session Replay.").

Additionally, even if you're using the snippet format [inline code](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/snippet-formats#inline-code "Learn how to select the format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case in the New RUM Experience."), make sure your CSP rules [allow the loading of external monitoring code](#allow-external-monitoring-code). This is important because the monitoring code for Session Replay Classic is always requested as an external file, regardless of the snippet format.

## Examples

Below is a basic example of a simple CSP rule:

```
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'; connect-src 'self';
```

The following examples show how this rule needs to be adapted for different RUM scenarios.

Examples for automatic injection

If you're using automatic injection with the default configuration for both the beacon endpoint and the monitoring code source, the basic CSP rule above is sufficientâas long as Session Replay Classic is not enabled, and the snippet format [OneAgent JavaScript tag](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/snippet-formats#oneagent-js-tag "Learn how to select the format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case in the New RUM Experience.") is used.

If the snippet format is changed to inline code, you must allow inline scripts by adding `'unsafe-inline'`:

```
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; connect-src 'self';
```

If the monitoring code is loaded from the CDN, update the `script-src` directive accordingly:

```
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' https://js-cdn.dynatracelabs.com; connect-src 'self';
```

If the beacon endpoint is changed to a Cluster ActiveGate, update the `connect-src` directive:

```
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' https://ab12345cde.bf.dynatrace.com/bf;
```

If you use Session Replay Classic, you also need to configure the `worker-src` directive:

```
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'; connect-src 'self';  worker-src blob:;
```

Examples for agentless monitoring

For agentless monitoring, both `script-src` and `connect-src` must be adjusted:

```
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' https://js-cdn.dynatracelabs.com; connect-src 'self' https://ab12345cde.bf.dynatrace.com/bf;
```

If you're using inline code, include `'unsafe-inline'` in `script-src`:

```
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; connect-src 'self' https://ab12345cde.bf.dynatrace.com/bf;
```

If beacons are sent to an instrumented web or app server, include its URL in `connect-src`:

```
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' https://js-cdn.dynatracelabs.com; connect-src 'self' http://www.example.com/rb_abcdefghi;
```

If you use Session Replay Classic, you need to configure the `worker-src` directive:

```
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' https://js-cdn.dynatracelabs.com; connect-src 'self' https://ab12345cde.bf.dynatrace.com/bf; worker-src blob:;
```

If you use Session Replay Classic with the inline code format, you need to configure the `worker-src` directive and include both `'unsafe-inline'` and the code source URL in `script-src`:

```
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' https://js-cdn.dynatracelabs.com 'unsafe-inline'; connect-src 'self' https://ab12345cde.bf.dynatrace.com/bf; worker-src blob:;
```

# Configure automatic injection in the New RUM Experience

# Configure automatic injection in the New RUM Experience

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Updated on Jan 08, 2026

Once OneAgent is deployed in full-stack monitoring mode on a host, it by default automatically injects the RUM JavaScript into the HTML of your web frontends for the technologies listed in [Technology support - Real User Monitoring - Web servers and applications](/docs/ingest-from/technology-support#rum-auto-injection "Find technical details related to Dynatrace support for specific platforms and development frameworks."). To initiate injection, simply restart your web server processes after installing OneAgent.

## Overview

By default, injection follows a set of [built-in rules for automatic injection](#where-is-rum-js-injected), but there are scenarios where you may need to define a [custom injection rule](#custom-injection-rule) to achieve injection. Custom injection rules also support the [exclusion of specific pages from injection](#disable-injection), which allows you to set up [manual insertion for the pages of an auto-injected frontend](#manual-insertion-using-oneagent).

The RUM JavaScript snippet injected into your application's HTML can have different formats, each designed to meet specific requirements as outlined in [Select a snippet format in the New RUM Experience](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/snippet-formats "Learn how to select the format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case in the New RUM Experience.").
To configure the format used for automatic injection, refer to [Configure the snippet format](#configure-snippet-format).

OneAgent injects the RUM JavaScript into each page based on the current configuration whenever the instrumented web or application server delivers the page. However, the pageâs caching policy determines how frequently OneAgent has the opportunity to perform this injection. To address this, OneAgent includes a feature that optimizes cache control headers. For details on how this feature works and its limitations, see [Cache control header optimizations](#cache-header-optimization).

## Built-in rules for automatic injection

OneAgent detects responses that contain HTML content and injects the RUM JavaScript into the `<head>` element of each page. It does not modify other resources such as images, CSS files, JSON or XML documents, or plain text.

OneAgent tries to inject the RUM JavaScript as the first script on the page, which helps to ensure reliable monitoring results. Injection only works with valid HTML that follows basic best practicesâfor example, ensuring all elements are properly opened and closed. OneAgent follows the built-in rules specified below to determine the most suitable location within an HTML document for injecting the RUM JavaScript.

### Automatic injection rules specification

Name

Condition

Action

Overrules

`<!DOCTYPE>`

The `<!DOCTYPE>` tag is not `<!DOCTYPE html>`.

Abort and do not inject. Note that only a single Doctype declaration is allowed.

initial tag

A tag appears before `<html>` that is not one of the following:

* `<!DOCTYPE ...>`
* `<html>`
* `<link>`
* `<meta>`
* `<script>`
* `<style>`

Abort without injecting.

`<?xml?>`

An `<?xml ...?>` specification is encountered.

Ignore and continue to scan the document.

non-`<meta>` tag

non-`<head>` tag

initial tag

`<html>` tag

The `<html>` tag is encountered.

If a potential injection point is found earlier, inject there, and do not scan further. If there are multiple potential injection points, the earliest one is used.

Otherwise, continue to scan the document

`<script src>` tag

A `<script src="...">` tag is found within `<head>`.

If a potential injection point is found earlier, inject there, and do not scan further. If there are multiple potential injection points, the earliest one is used.

Otherwise, inject before this `<script>` tag and do not scan further.

non-`<meta>` tag

`<base>`/`<meta>` tag

`<title>`/`<noscript>` tag

The `<title>` or the `<noscript>` tag is encountered.

Ignore everything until the `</title>` or the `</noscript>` tag, then continue to scan the document.

`<body>` tag

`<base>`/`<meta>` tag

Either the `<base>` or the `<meta>` tag is encountered.

Discard any conditional injection point found earlier. Continue to scan the document.

Any conditional injection point found earlier by:

non-`<meta>` tag

unclosed `<meta>`

non-`<head>` tag

non-`<meta>` tag

A tag is found within `<head>` that is neither `<meta>` nor `<title>`.

Inject before it (conditional injection).

Continue to scan the document, in case this injection choice is overruled.

unclosed `<meta>`

The `</head>` tag arrives after a `<meta>` tag that isn't closed either by the closing `</meta>` tag or by the XML-style `<meta ... />` tag.

Add `</meta>` followed by the injection, both before the `</head>` (conditional injection).

Continue to scan the document, in case this injection choice is overruled.

comment

The `<!- comment ->` tag is encountered.

Ignore and continue to scan the document.

non-`<meta>` tag

non-`<head>` tag

non-`<head>` tag

A tag is found after `<html>` but before `<head>` that is neither `<head>` nor `<body>`.

Inject before it (conditional injection).

Continue to scan the document, in case this injection choice is overruled.

`</head>` tag

The `</head>` tag encountered.

If a potential injection point is found earlier, inject there and do not scan further. If there are multiple potential injection points, the earliest is used.

Otherwise, continue to scan the document.

flush

Java only

Flush is called on the injecting stream/writer outside of the `<head></head>` section and a conditional injection awaits confirmation.

Discard the conditional injection point, propagate the flush, and continue to scan the document for a new injection point.

Any conditional injection point found before by:

non-`<head>` tag

flush in `<head>`

Java only

Flush is called on the injecting stream/writer inside `<head></head>` and conditional injection awaits confirmation.

Keep the injection point and continue to scan the document.

Disregard the flush.

`<body>` tag

The `<body>` tag is encountered.

Document scan stops. Any potential injection point found earlier is used. If there are multiple potential injection points, the earliest one is used.

If no rule matched earlier, inject after the `<body>`.

end of file

End of file is reached and scanning didn't terminate before that.

Don't perform an injection.

Any conditional injection point found before by:

non-`<meta>` tag

unclosed `<meta>`

non-`<head>` tag

parse error

The document's contents don't appear to exhibit the basic structure expected from HTML tags and attributes.

Document scan stops.

If a potential injection point is found earlier, inject there, and do not scan further. If there are multiple potential injection points, the earliest one is used.

If no rule provides an earlier injection point, don't perform an injection.

## Explicitly specify where the RUM JavaScript should be injected

In some cases, OneAgent may be unable to perform injection using the built-in rules. This is typically due to malformed HTML, though other rare conditions may also prevent the ruleset from identifying a suitable injection point. In such scenarios, you can achieve automatic injection by defining a custom injection rule that explicitly specifies where the RUM JavaScript should be injected within the HTML document.

To create a custom injection rule that specifies the injection point in the HTML document

1. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** > **Overview**.
2. Select  **Web** to view all web frontends.
3. Select the frontend you want to configure.
4. On the **Settings** tab, select ![Settings](https://dt-cdn.net/images/settings-icon-256-38e1321b51.webp "Settings") **Open in Settings**.
5. Go to **Collect and capture** > **Frontend** > **Injection** > **Custom injection rules**.
6. Select **Add custom rule**.
7. Define the **Operator** and, if required, the corresponding **URL pattern** to control to which pages your custom injection rule applies.
8. Under **Rule**, select either **Before specific HTML** or **After specific HTML**, and enter the corresponding HTML pattern.
9. Select **Save changes** to create the custom injection rule.

## Disable injection for particular pages

To disable injection for one or more pages within your frontend

1. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** > **Overview**.
2. Select  **Web** to view all web frontends.
3. Select the frontend you want to configure.
4. On the **Settings** tab, select ![Settings](https://dt-cdn.net/images/settings-icon-256-38e1321b51.webp "Settings") **Open in Settings**.
5. Go to **Collect and capture** > **Frontend** > **Injection** > **Custom injection rules**.
6. Select **Add custom rule**.
7. Define the **Operator** and, if required, the corresponding **URL pattern** to control to which pages your custom injection rule applies.
8. Under **Rule**, select **Do not inject**.
9. Select **Save changes** to create the custom injection rule.

This rule only disables injection and [cache control header optimizations](#cache-header-optimization); it does not fully disable RUM functionality. For instance, cookies may still be set. If you're looking for a way to selectively enable RUM, please refer to the instructions in [Roll out RUM selectively for your applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/selective-rum-rollout "Roll out RUM selectively after installing OneAgent in full-stack monitoring mode on your hosts").

## Configure the snippet format

To configure the snippet format for automatic injection

1. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** > **Overview**.
2. Select  **Web** to view all web frontends.
3. Select the frontend you want to configure.
4. On the **Settings** tab, select **Automatic injection**.
5. Under **Snippet format**, select the desired format.
6. Select **Save**.

To learn more about the different snippet formats, refer to [Select a snippet format in the New RUM Experience](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/snippet-formats "Learn how to select the format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case in the New RUM Experience.").

## Cache control header optimizations

Enabled by default

Your application's caching policy plays a key role in determining whether OneAgent can inject the RUM JavaScript into a page using the current configuration. To ensure timely application of configuration changes, the cache control header optimizations feature modifies HTTP headers so that conditional requests result in a cache miss whenever the RUM configuration has changed, giving OneAgent a chance to inject. Details of these optimizations and the specific header modifications are provided below.

Cache control header optimizations specification

When cache control header optimizations are turned on and the RUM configuration has been changed, the requests that would otherwise result in `304 Not Modified` respond with `200 OK`, giving OneAgent a chance to inject the RUM JavaScript into your application HTML code. If the RUM configuration hasn't been changed, the requests result in a `304 Not Modified` response.

### Modified headers

OneAgent modifies the following response and request headers:

#### Response headers

* `ETag`
* `Last-Modified`

#### Request headers

* `If-None-Match`
* `If-Modified-Since`
* `If-Unmodified-Since`[1](#fn-1-1-def)
* `If-Match`[1](#fn-1-1-def)

1

Not modified for range requests, which are generally excluded from RUM monitoring.

Here's how OneAgent modifies the cache control headers.

#### When the RUM configuration is changed

* The incoming `If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since` request headers are removed.
* Modifications made to the `If-Unmodified-Since` and `If-Match` headers are removed.
* When both `ETag` and `Last-Modified` headers are used:

  + A suffix is appended to the `ETag` header.
  + One second is subtracted from the `Last-Modified` header.
* When only the `ETag` header is used:

  + A suffix is appended to the `ETag` header.
* When only the `Last-Modified` header is used:

  + The `ETag` header is created.
  + One second is subtracted from the `Last-Modified` header.

#### When the RUM configuration isn't changed

* Before the request is handled by the web or app server, the modifications made to the headers are removed so that the web or app server doesn't see the changes.

When the application consists of multiple instrumented tiers, the changes to the `ETag` and `Last-Modified` headers are applied on each tier.

OneAgent does not alter the `Expires` and `Cache-Control` headers, which explicitly define resource expiration times. To ensure timely updates, we recommend setting shorter expiration durations in these headers.

### Disabling cache control header optimizations

In rare cases, cache control header optimizations may interfere with your application's functionality. If this occurs, you can disable the feature.
When disabled, the rollout of new RUM configurations will depend entirely on your application's existing caching behavior.

To disable the cache control header optimizations

1. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** > **Overview**.
2. Select  **Web** to view all web frontends.
3. Select the frontend you want to configure.
4. On the **Settings** tab, select **Automatic injection**.
5. Turn off **Optimize the value of cache control headers for use with Dynatrace Real User Monitoring**.
6. Select **Save**.

### Disabling cache control header optimizations for non-HTML resources

In some cases, OneAgent may modify the cache control headers of non-HTML resources. This occurs because header modifications are applied before the exact content type can be determined. While OneAgent excludes certain resources from cache control header optimizations based on their URI suffix, it's not possible to account for all non-HTML content types.

If you want to prevent cache control header modifications for specific non-HTML resources, you can create a [custom injection rule that disables injection for those resources](#disable-injection).

## Use manual insertion for pages of an auto-injected frontend

If OneAgent is deployed on your process groups and automatic injection is supported for your technology, then OneAgent injects the RUM JavaScript automatically by default. But if you prefer, you can insert it manually instead into all or specific pages.

First, you need to suppress automatic injection as described in [Disable injection for particular pages](#disable-injection). Then, to insert the RUM JavaScript manually

1. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** > **Overview**.
2. Select  **Web** to view all web frontends.
3. Select the frontend you want to configure.
4. On the **Settings** tab, select **Manual insertion**.
5. Scroll to the section for the snippet format you want to use and select  to copy the RUM JavaScript to the clipboard.
6. Insert the snippet in your HTML before any other scripts.

Alternatively, you can also retrieve the snippet via the [API](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/rum-manual-insertion-tags "Learn how you can download the RUM manual insertion tags via API"), which allows you to integrate its insertion into your build process. This ensures that your frontend consistently operates with the latest configuration.

# Configure the beacon endpoint for web frontends in the New RUM Experience

# Configure the beacon endpoint for web frontends in the New RUM Experience

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Updated on Jan 07, 2026

The RUM JavaScript sends beacons to Dynatrace to report captured data. The URL where these beacons are delivered is defined by the beacon endpoint. This guide describes the default beacon endpoint, which is suitable for most environments, and then outlines the available configuration options for scenarios that require customization.

## Default beacon endpoint

By default, the beacon endpoint depends on the instrumentation method used for your application:

### Auto-injected frontends

If the [RUM JavaScript is injected automatically](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/set-up-auto-injected-frontend "Learn how to set up an auto-injected web frontend in the New RUM Experience."), beacons are sent to your web or application server, where OneAgent provides a beacon endpoint that intercepts and forwards them. For this purpose, a root-relative URL is used, with the last path segment prefixed by `rb_`. The exact URL path depends on the technology:

* **Java or IIS:** The path segment is added to the context root if available, for example: `/myapplication/rb_bf12345abc`.
* **Other technologies or when a context root is unavailable:** The path segment is added to the root, for example: `/rb_bf12345abc`. This is also the default if you manually insert the RUM JavaScript as described in [Use manual insertion for pages of an auto-injected frontend](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-auto-injection#manual-insertion-using-oneagent "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your frontends in the New RUM Experience.").

### Agentless monitoring

If you use [agentless monitoring](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/set-up-agentless-monitoring "Learn how to set up agentless RUM for your web frontends in the New RUM Experience."), data is sent to a Cluster ActiveGate that is part of the Dynatrace SaaS infrastructure.

## Configuration options

In certain scenarios, you might need to use an alternative beacon endpoint configuration. For example:

* If your infrastructure blocks beacons of an auto-injected frontend because of their default URL path.
* If you want the monitoring traffic of an auto-injected frontend to bypass your CDN.
* If you prefer RUM beacons not to be handled on the web or application server that hosts your application.

The following sections describe alternative beacon endpoint configurations that allow you to accommodate these and similar constraints.

### Auto-injected frontend Modify the beacon endpoint URL path

Depending on your infrastructure and its configuration, beacons might not pass with their automatically chosen URL and therefore canât be handled by OneAgent. To resolve this, you can change the part of the beacon endpoint URL path that comes before the `rb_` prefix. You can't remove the path segment prefixed by `rb_`, as itâs required for OneAgent to identify RUM beacons.

To modify the beacon endpoint URL for an auto-injected application

1. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** > **Overview**.
2. Select  **Web** to view all web frontends.
3. Select the frontend you want to configure.
4. On the **Settings** tab, select ![Settings](https://dt-cdn.net/images/settings-icon-256-38e1321b51.webp "Settings") **Open in Settings**.
5. Go to **Collect and capture** > **Frontend** > **Beacon endpoint**.
6. In the **Type** dropdown list, select **OneAgent**.
7. Under **URL**, enter a relative or root-relative URL.
8. Select **Save changes**.

#### Examples

The following examples assume that RUM beacons are sent to `/rb_bf12345abc` by default.

* **Root-relative URL:** If you set **URL** to `/custompath`, the beacons will be sent to `/custompath/rb_bf12345abc`.
* **Relative URL:** If you set **URL** to `./`, then the URL where the RUM JavaScript sends beacons is relative to the current page. For example:

  + If the current page is `/shop/index.html`, then the beacons are sent to `/shop/rb_bf12345abc`.
  + If the current page is `/account/dashboard/`, then the beacons are sent to `/account/dashboard/rb_bf12345abc`.

### Auto-injected frontend Send beacons to Dynatrace SaaS infrastructure

If you want the RUM beacons of an auto-injected frontend to be handled by Dynatrace SaaS infrastructure instead of OneAgent, follow the steps below.

1. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** > **Overview**.
2. Select  **Web** to view all web frontends.
3. Select the frontend you want to configure.
4. On the **Settings** tab, select ![Settings](https://dt-cdn.net/images/settings-icon-256-38e1321b51.webp "Settings") **Open in Settings**.
5. Go to **Collect and capture** > **Frontend** > **Beacon endpoint**.
6. In the **Type** dropdown list, select **Cluster ActiveGate**.
7. Select **Save changes**.

With this configuration, Dynatrace applies the [beacon origin allowlist](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/additional-configuration/configure-beacon-origin-allowlist "Specify the origins from which cross-origin RUM beacons should be accepted.") to the RUM beacons of your frontend.

### Auto-injected frontend Send beacons to a different web server

By default, RUM beacons from an auto-injected frontend are handled by OneAgent on one of the process groups that host your application. Alternatively, beacons can be handled on any other instrumented web or application server of a technology listed in [Technology support - Real User Monitoring - Web servers and applications](/docs/ingest-from/technology-support#rum-auto-injection "Find technical details related to Dynatrace support for specific platforms and development frameworks.").

To send beacons of an auto-injected frontend to a different instrumented server

1. In the injected RUM JavaScript, find `beaconUri` and copy the last segment of the URL path, which is prefixed with `rb_`.
2. Append this value to the URL of the instrumented web or application server.

   For example, if the last segment of `beaconUri` is `/rb_bf12345abc` and the server URL is `http://www.my-server.com`, the resulting beacon endpoint URL is `http://www.my-server.com/rb_bf12345abc`.
3. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** > **Overview**.
4. Select  **Web** to view all web frontends.
5. Select the frontend you want to configure.
6. On the **Settings** tab, select ![Settings](https://dt-cdn.net/images/settings-icon-256-38e1321b51.webp "Settings") **Open in Settings**.
7. Go to **Collect and capture** > **Frontend** > **Beacon endpoint**.
8. In the **Type** dropdown list, select **OneAgent**.
9. In **URL**, enter the beacon endpoint that you determined in step 2.
10. Turn on **Send beacon data via CORS**.
11. Select **Save changes**.

With this configuration, Dynatrace applies the [beacon origin allowlist](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/additional-configuration/configure-beacon-origin-allowlist "Specify the origins from which cross-origin RUM beacons should be accepted.") to the RUM beacons of your frontend.

# Configure the Real User Monitoring code source in the New RUM Experience

# Configure the Real User Monitoring code source in the New RUM Experience

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Updated on Jan 28, 2026

In the majority of RUM scenarios, at least one additional request for monitoring code is issued by the browser:

* All snippet formats except for [inline code](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/snippet-formats#inline-code "Learn how to select the format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case in the New RUM Experience.") include monitoring code as an external resource, which is requested separately by the browser.
* The monitoring code for Session Replay Classic is always requested separately, even if the used snippet format is inline code.

The Real User Monitoring code source determines where the monitoring code is loaded from and which URL is used for these requests.

## Default behavior

By default, a monitoring code source is applied that is suitable for most environments and varies based on the instrumentation method used for your frontend. This section describes the default behavior in detail, and the next outlines configuration options for scenarios that require customization.

### Agentless monitoring

If you opted for [agentless monitoring](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/set-up-agentless-monitoring "Learn how to set up agentless RUM for your web frontends in the New RUM Experience."), the monitoring code is requested from the Dynatrace CDN. In case of the snippet format [JavaScript tag](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/snippet-formats#js-tag "Learn how to select the format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case in the New RUM Experience."), the filename ends with `_complete.js` and contains a frontend identifier (for example, `7cab1abeacdfe1_complete.js`). For all other formats, it starts with `ruxitagent_` and contains information about the active code modules and monitoring code version (for example, `ruxitagent_ICA1589ENPQRTUVXfghqru_10307250124095659.js`). The filename of the Session Replay Classic monitoring code starts with `ruxitagent_` (for example, `ruxitagent_D_10307250124095659.js`) for all snippet formats.

### Automatic injection

If the [RUM JavaScript is injected automatically](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/set-up-auto-injected-frontend "Learn how to set up an auto-injected web frontend in the New RUM Experience."), both RUM and Session Replay Classic monitoring code are requested from your web or application server using a root-relative URL where the filename starts with `ruxitagentjs_` and contains information about the active code modules and monitoring code version. The exact URL path depends on the technology:

* **Java or IIS:** The filename is added to the context root if available, for example: `/contextroot/ruxitagentjs_ICA1589ENPQRTUVXfghqru_10307250124095659.js`.
* **Other technologies or when a context root is unavailable:** The filename is added to the root, for example: `/ruxitagentjs_ICA1589ENPQRTUVXfghqru_10307250124095659.js`. This is also the default if you manually insert the RUM JavaScript as described in [Use manual insertion for pages of an auto-injected frontend](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-auto-injection#manual-insertion-using-oneagent "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your frontends in the New RUM Experience.").

### Manual insertion for pages of an auto-injected frontend

If the [RUM JavaScript is inserted manually even though your process groups are instrumented with OneAgent](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-auto-injection#manual-insertion-using-oneagent "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your frontends in the New RUM Experience."), the monitoring code, like with automatic injection, is requested from your web or application server using a root-relative URL where the filename starts with `ruxitagentjs_`. The only exception here is the snippet format JavaScript tag, where the RUM monitoring code is requested from the CDN and the filename ends with `_complete.js`. The Session Replay Classic monitoring code is requested from your web or application server and has a filename starting with `ruxitagentjs_` for all snippet formats.

## Configuration options

In certain scenarios, you may need to use an alternative monitoring code source configuration. For example:

* If your infrastructure blocks monitoring code requests of an auto-injected frontend because of their default URL path.
* If you prefer monitoring code requests not to be handled on the web or application server that hosts your application.
* If you want to prevent ad blockers from blocking the monitoring code.

The following configuration options allow you to address these constraints.

### Auto-injected frontend Modify the monitoring code URL path

Depending on your infrastructure and its configuration, it's possible that requests for monitoring code can't pass with their automatically chosen URL path and thus can't be handled by OneAgent. To solve this, you can change the part of the URL path that comes before the `ruxitagentjs_` prefix.

To modify the RUM monitoring code URL path for an auto-injected frontend

1. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** > **Overview**.
2. Select  **Web** to view all web frontends.
3. Select the frontend you want to configure.
4. On the **Settings** tab, select **Automatic injection**.
5. In the **Real User Monitoring code source** dropdown list, select **OneAgent**.
6. In **Specify path for RUM monitoring code**, enter the relative monitoring code URL path.
7. Select **Save**.

Note that you can't eliminate the path segment prefixed by `ruxitagentjs_`, which is necessary for the identification of the request as a monitoring code request.

#### Examples

The following examples assume that the monitoring code is requested from `/ruxitagentjs_ICA1589ENPQRTUVXfghqru_10307250124095659.js` by default.

* **Root-relative URL:** If you configure the path `/custompath`, the monitoring code will be requested from `/custompath/ruxitagentjs_ICA1589ENPQRTUVXfghqru_10307250124095659.js`.
* **Relative URL:** If you configure the path `./`, the URL where the monitoring code is requested from is relative to the current page. For example:

  + If the current page is `/shop/index.html`, then the monitoring code is requested from `/shop/ruxitagentjs_ICA1589ENPQRTUVXfghqru_10307250124095659.js`.
  + If the current page is `/account/dashboard/`, then the monitoring code is requested from `/account/dashboard/ruxitagentjs_ICA1589ENPQRTUVXfghqru_10307250124095659.js`.

This configuration is not only effective for automatic injection, but also for [manual insertion for pages of an auto-injected frontend](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-auto-injection#manual-insertion-using-oneagent "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your frontends in the New RUM Experience."). The only exception is the `_complete.js` request for the JavaScript snippet format, which will still go to the Dynatrace CDN.

### Auto-injected frontend Request the monitoring code from the Dynatrace CDN

Note that all connected ActiveGates must be on ActiveGate version 1.310+ for at least 30 days before this feature becomes available.

If you want the monitoring code for an auto-injected frontend to be requested from the Dynatrace CDN instead of OneAgent, follow the steps below.

1. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** > **Overview**.
2. Select  **Web** to view all web frontends.
3. Select the frontend you want to configure.
4. On the **Settings** tab, select **Automatic injection**.
5. In the **Real User Monitoring code source** dropdown list, select **CDN**.
6. Select **Save**.

This configuration is effective for both automatic injection and [manual insertion for pages of an auto-injected frontend](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-auto-injection#manual-insertion-using-oneagent "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your frontends in the New RUM Experience."). Using it, filenames previously starting with `ruxitagentjs_` will start with `ruxitagent_` instead.

### Configure a custom monitoring code filename prefix

After changing the monitoring code filename prefix, you may experience a temporary reduction in collected RUM data. Therefore, we recommend avoiding frequent changes to this setting.

By default, the monitoring code filename is prefixed with `ruxitagent` or `ruxitagentjs`, unless the snippet format JavaScript tag is used. Alternatively, you can specify a custom prefix, which will be used instead for both agentless and auto-injected frontends, as well as for both RUM and Session Replay Classic monitoring code.

To specify a custom monitoring code filename prefix

1. Go to ![Settings](https://dt-cdn.net/images/settings-icon-256-38e1321b51.webp "Settings") **Settings** > **Collect and capture** > **Real User Monitoring** > **Frontend** > **RUM monitoring code filename**.
2. In **Custom filename prefix**, enter the desired custom prefix.
3. Select **Save changes**.

# Enable the New RUM Experience for your RUM Classic web applications

# Enable the New RUM Experience for your RUM Classic web applications

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Updated on Jan 28, 2026

If you already monitor your web frontends with RUM Classic, upgrading to the New RUM Experience requires only a configuration change. This guide outlines the prerequisites and necessary steps.

## Prerequisites

Before enabling the New RUM Experience, make sure the following conditions are met.

#### Required to enable the setting

* RUM Classic is enabled at the levelâfrontend or environmentâwhere you want to enable the New RUM Experience.
* The RUM JavaScript version is RUM JavaScript version 1.317+.
* The snippet format code snippet, which is not supported by the New RUM Experience, isn't used. For alternatives, see [Recommendations for selecting the snippet format](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/snippet-formats#snippet-format-recommendations "Learn how to select the format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case in the New RUM Experience.").

#### Required to capture and ingest data

* The OneAgent version is OneAgent version 1.301+.
* Because new features are added regularly, we recommend keeping both OneAgent and the RUM JavaScript up to date. The RUM JavaScript version should be configured to either **Latest stable** or **Previous stable**, as described in [Configure the RUM JavaScript version for a frontend](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/additional-configuration/rum-javascript-version#configure-js-version "Learn how to control the RUM JavaScript version used to monitor your frontends in the New RUM Experience.").

## Enable the New RUM Experience for a web frontend

To enable the New RUM Experience for a web frontend

1. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** > **Overview**.
2. Select  **Web** to view all web frontends.
3. Select the frontend you want to configure.
4. Switch to the **Settings** tab.
5. Under **Enablement and cost control**, turn on **RUM**.
6. Optionally, enable **User Interactions** to capture user interactions such as clicks and scrolls.

If you use automatic injection, the new configuration is applied within 5 minutes. If you insert the RUM JavaScript manually, you may need to update the snippet, depending on the [snippet format](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/snippet-formats "Learn how to select the format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case in the New RUM Experience.") youâre using:

* **JavaScript tag**: The new configuration is applied automatically, but it may not take effect immediately due to caching. The file that contains the monitoring code and configuration is cached for one hour on the Dynatrace CDN. Additionally, browsers respect the [configured cache duration](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/snippet-formats#cache-duration "Learn how to select the format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case in the New RUM Experience.").
* **OneAgent JavaScript tag**, **OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI** or **inline code**: As with any configuration change, you need to update the inserted snippet.

## Enable the New RUM Experience at the environment level

To enable the New RUM Experience for web frontends at the environment level

1. Go to ![Settings](https://dt-cdn.net/images/settings-icon-256-38e1321b51.webp "Settings") **Settings** > **Collect and capture** > **Real User Monitoring** > **Traffic and cost control** > **Web frontends**.
2. Turn on **Enable New Real User Monitoring Experience**. Note that this setting is displayed only if **Enable Real User Monitoring Classic** is enabled; see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

## Enable the New RUM Experience via API

The Settings API allows you to enable the New RUM Experience either for a web frontend or at the environment level. For details, see [Settings API - Enablement and cost control schema table](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/settings/schemas/builtin-rum-web-enablement "View builtin:rum.web.enablement settings schema table of your monitoring environment via the Dynatrace API.").

Unless you use the **JavaScript tag** snippet format, you need to update the snippet after you've enabled the New RUM Experience if it was manually inserted. For more information, see [Enable the New RUM Experience for a web frontend](#enable-new-rum-for-web-frontend). To retrieve the updated snippet, use the [RUM manual insertion tags API](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/rum-manual-insertion-tags "Learn how you can download the RUM manual insertion tags via API").

# Finalize the initial setup for your agentless frontend

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Published Jan 29, 2026

After [setting up a new agentless frontend](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/set-up-agentless-monitoring "Learn how to set up agentless RUM for your web frontends in the New RUM Experience."), the charts in [![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/experience-vitals "The Experience Vitals app provides an entry point for monitoring web and mobile frontends.") should begin displaying data within ten minutes if your frontend is receiving traffic. If they don't, your setup may require further configuration steps. This guide walks you through a series of checks to help you identify the configuration needed.

## Verify that the monitoring code downloads successfully

Unless you selected the snippet format [inline code](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/snippet-formats#inline-code "Learn how to select the format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case in the New RUM Experience."), the monitoring code is downloaded as a separate file. In environments that do not have a [custom monitoring code filename prefix](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-monitoring-code-source#configure-custom-monitoring-code-filename-prefix "Configure the Real User Monitoring code source in the New RUM Experience to meet your specific requirements.") configured, the filename starts with the prefix `ruxitagent_`.

If the browser developer tools show a `200 OK` response for this request, the download was successful and you can continue to [Verify that RUM beacons are being sent to Dynatrace](#beacons). Otherwise, further configuration is required.

![Successful download of the RUM monitoring code in an agentless frontend](https://dt-cdn.net/images/rum-monitoring-code-successful-download-agentless-1416-42fa2db754.png)

### CSP rule violations

If you see CSP rule violations in the browser console associated with loading the monitoring code, adjust the CSP rules defined in your application. For details, see [Allow the loading of external monitoring code](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/adapt-csp-rules#allow-external-monitoring-code "Learn how to adapt your CSP rules for the New RUM Experience.").

### Requests are blocked by infrastructure components

Monitoring code requests may be blocked by infrastructure components such as firewalls and proxies. Ensure that your infrastructure allows these requests to pass; see [Firewall constraints for RUM](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/rum-firewall-latest "Find out how to make sure that Real User Monitoring data passes through your firewall.").

## Verify that RUM beacons are being sent to Dynatrace

The RUM JavaScript sends beacons containing captured data to the [beacon endpoint](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-beacon-endpoint "Learn how to configure the beacon endpoint for web frontends to meet your specific requirements."). By default, the beacon endpoint for an agentless frontend is a Cluster ActiveGate that is part of the Dynatrace SaaS infrastructure. If the New RUM Experience is active, beacons in a new format are sent alongside RUM Classic beacons to the same endpoint.

To identify RUM beacons in your browser's developer tools, look for requests with the URL path `/bf` or `/bf/<id>`. Beacons in the new format include the query string parameter `pv=4`.

![RUM beacons in the new format sent to SaaS infrastructure](https://dt-cdn.net/images/rum-beacon-new-format-agentless-1414-5c74d390ad.png)

### No beacons being sent

If the browser developer tools don't show any beacons, check the following aspects of your setup:

* If you enabled [data-collection and opt-in mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/additional-configuration/data-privacy-web#data-collection-and-opt-in-mode "Learn about the available settings that help you ensure your web frontends comply with data privacy regulations.") during setup, your code needs to call [`dtrum.enable()`ï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/doc/javascriptapi/doc/types/dtrum.html#enable) from the JavaScript API after the user accepts your data privacy policy. Only then will the RUM JavaScript begin sending data.
* If you selected the snippet format [inline code](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/snippet-formats#inline-code "Learn how to select the format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case in the New RUM Experience."), your browser's console may display a CSP rule violation indicating that an inline script was blocked. In this case, adjust your CSP rules as described in [Allow the execution of inline code](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/adapt-csp-rules#allow-the-execution-of-inline-code "Learn how to adapt your CSP rules for the New RUM Experience.").

### Beacons blocked due to CSP rule violations

If you see CSP rule violations in the console indicating that a the connection to the beacon endpoint was blocked, adjust the CSP rules in your application. For details, see [Allow sending RUM beacons](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/adapt-csp-rules#allow-sending-rum-beacons "Learn how to adapt your CSP rules for the New RUM Experience.").

### Beacon origin is not in the allowlist

If the browser console shows CORS errors and beacon requests return an `403 Forbidden` response, your environment has a beacon origin allowlist configured that does not allow beacons from the page you are instrumenting. Add a rule that allows them as described in [Add rules to the beacon origin allowlist](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/additional-configuration/configure-beacon-origin-allowlist#add-rules "Specify the origins from which cross-origin RUM beacons should be accepted.").

### RUM is turned off for "Do Not Track"-enabled browsers

If the beacon requests in the new format return a `202 Accepted` response code and a JSON response body with a field `"errorReason":"Do Not Track"`, this means that the option **Turn Real User Monitoring off for "Do Not Track"-enabled browsers** is enabled in the [data privacy settings](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/additional-configuration/data-privacy-web#comply-with-dnt "Learn about the available settings that help you ensure your web frontends comply with data privacy regulations."), and your browser is configured to include the `DNT` header. In this case, the beacons aren't forwarded to Dynatrace by the beacon endpoint.

![RUM beacon rejected due to Do Not Track](https://dt-cdn.net/images/rum-beacon-rejected-dnt-1120-d28b4cf9bd.png)

While verifying your setup, configure your browser to not include the `DNT` header.

### Requests are blocked by infrastructure components

Beacon requests may be blocked by infrastructure components such as firewalls and proxies. You can determine where a beacon request was handled by looking at the response body:

* Beacon requests that failed at the beacon endpoint return a JSON response containing the fields `status`, `handler`, `errorCode`, and `errorReason`.
* Beacons intercepted by a firewall or similar component do not include this JSON response.

The second scenario can be prevented by ensuring that your infrastructure complies with the [firewall constraints for RUM](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/rum-firewall-latest "Find out how to make sure that Real User Monitoring data passes through your firewall."). An exception is the error code `429 Too Many Requests`, which may also be returned by SaaS infrastructure; in this case, reach out to Dynatrace support.

### No beacons in the new format are sent

If beacons are being sent, but you cannot find any in the new format, the New RUM Experience may not have been activated. See [Enable the New RUM Experience for your RUM Classic web applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/enable-new-rum-for-web-apps "Learn how to enable the New RUM Experience for your RUM Classic web applications") to learn how to activate it.

# Finalize the initial setup for your auto-injected frontend

# Finalize the initial setup for your auto-injected frontend

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Published Jan 29, 2026

After [setting up a new auto-injected frontend](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/set-up-auto-injected-frontend "Learn how to set up an auto-injected web frontend in the New RUM Experience."), the charts in [![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/experience-vitals "The Experience Vitals app provides an entry point for monitoring web and mobile frontends.") should begin displaying data within ten minutes if your frontend is receiving traffic. If they don't, your setup may require further configuration steps. This guide walks you through a series of checks to help you identify whether further configuration is needed.

## Check whether RUM data is mapped to a different frontend

The frontend to which the captured data is mapped is determined by the frontend detection rules you specified during setup. If the defined rules fail to map the HTML document requests to the intended frontend, the captured data is assigned to another frontend with a matching rule, orâif no rule matchesâto the [catch-all frontend](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/set-up-auto-injected-frontend#deploy-oneagent "Learn how to set up an auto-injected web frontend in the New RUM Experience.").

### Determine whether data has been captured

To check whether data has been captured and mapped to another frontend

1. Go to ![Notebooks](https://dt-cdn.net/images/notebooks-768-046137830a.webp "Notebooks") **Notebooks** and open an existing notebook, or create a new one by selecting  **Notebook**.
2. Select  > **DQL**.
3. Run the following DQL query, replacing `https://example.com/path` with the URL of the page you're instrumenting. Use the URL as requested by the browser, without any server-side rewrites.

```
fetch user.events



| filter matchesPhrase(page.url.full, "https://example.com/path")



| filter matchesValue(dt.openpipeline.source, "rumagent")



| summarize by: {frontend.name}, count()
```

If the query returns an empty response, no user events have been captured for this page. In that case, continue to [Verify that the RUM JavaScript is injected](#injection).

### Identify the frontend where the data was mapped

The query returns the number of [user events](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/concepts/data-model#user-events "Get familiar with the data model at the heart of the New RUM Experience.") captured for the page and includes the `frontend.name` field, which specifies the frontend to which the events were mapped. To identify which frontend the returned `frontend.name` refers to

1. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** > **Overview**.
2. Select  **Web** to view all web frontends.
3. Select  to display the **frontend.name** column. You can now locate the `frontend.name` value from the query results in the table.

### Identify the cause

When RUM data is mapped to a different frontend than expected, it is typically due to one of the following causes:

* Use of the fragment identifier in the rule pattern, for example the `#overview` part in `https://example.com/docs#overview`. For more information on which parts of the URL are supported, see [Learn how frontend detection rules are applied](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/set-up-auto-injected-frontend#learn-application-of-detection-rules "Learn how to set up an auto-injected web frontend in the New RUM Experience.").
* Failure to account for uninstrumented components during setup. For more information, see [Account for uninstrumented components](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/set-up-auto-injected-frontend#account-for-uninstrumented-components "Learn how to set up an auto-injected web frontend in the New RUM Experience.").
* Failure to bring frontend detection rules in the correct order. For more information, see [Set the order of frontend detection rules](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/set-up-auto-injected-frontend#set-order-of-rules "Learn how to set up an auto-injected web frontend in the New RUM Experience.").

## Verify that the RUM JavaScript is injected

To verify that the RUM JavaScript is injected into the HTML of your page, look for a script element containing the attributes `data-config`, `data-envconfig`, and `data-appconfig`. If you find such an element, the RUM JavaScript has been injected, including the configuration for the New RUM Experience. In this case, continue to [Verify that the monitoring code downloads successfully](#monitoring-code).

If no script element with these attributes is present, check instead for a script element that contains the string `data-dtconfig`. If you find it, injection was successful, but the New RUM Experience is not active. See [Enable the New RUM Experience for your RUM Classic web applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/enable-new-rum-for-web-apps "Learn how to enable the New RUM Experience for your RUM Classic web applications") to learn how to activate it.

![Injected RUM JavaScript](https://dt-cdn.net/images/injected-rum-javascript-1046-e0d0d44dec.png)

If you cannot find any such script element, automatic injection did not occur.

### RUM is turned off for "Do Not Track"-enabled browsers

If you enabled **Turn Real User Monitoring off for "Do Not Track"-enabled browsers** in the [data privacy settings](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/additional-configuration/data-privacy-web#comply-with-dnt "Learn about the available settings that help you ensure your web frontends comply with data privacy regulations."), and your browser is configured to include the `DNT` header, OneAgent does not inject the RUM JavaScript. While verifying your setup, configure your browser to not include the `DNT` header.

### Malformed HTML

In some cases, OneAgent may be unable to perform injection using its built-in rules. This is typically due to malformed HTML, though other rare conditions may also prevent the ruleset from identifying a suitable injection point. To address this, create a [custom injection rule](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-auto-injection#custom-injection-rule "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your frontends in the New RUM Experience.") that injects before or after a specific HTML pattern.

## Verify that the monitoring code downloads successfully

Unless you selected the snippet format [inline code](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/snippet-formats#inline-code "Learn how to select the format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case in the New RUM Experience."), the monitoring code is downloaded as a separate file. In environments that do not have a [custom monitoring code filename prefix](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-monitoring-code-source#configure-custom-monitoring-code-filename-prefix "Configure the Real User Monitoring code source in the New RUM Experience to meet your specific requirements.") configured, the filename starts with one of the following prefixes:

* `ruxitagentjs_`âif the request is handled by OneAgent, which is the default behavior.
* `ruxitagent_`âif you configured the monitoring code to be [requested from the Dynatrace CDN](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-monitoring-code-source#request-rum-monitoring-code-from-cdn "Configure the Real User Monitoring code source in the New RUM Experience to meet your specific requirements.").

If the browser developer tools show a `200 OK` response for this request, the download was successful and you can continue to [Verify that RUM beacons are being sent to Dynatrace](#beacons). Otherwise, further configuration is required.

![Successful download of the RUM monitoring code](https://dt-cdn.net/images/rum-monitoring-code-successful-download-1348-feb695c704.png)

### CSP rule violations

If you see CSP rule violations in the browser console associated with loading the monitoring code, adjust the CSP rules defined in your application. For details, see [Allow the loading of external monitoring code](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/adapt-csp-rules#allow-external-monitoring-code "Learn how to adapt your CSP rules for the New RUM Experience.").

### No application deployed at the root

When OneAgent handles monitoring code requests, they are often [sent to the root of the web or app server](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-monitoring-code-source#default-behavior-auto-injection "Configure the Real User Monitoring code source in the New RUM Experience to meet your specific requirements."). These requests may return response codes such as `404 Not Found` or `503 Service Unavailable` if no application is deployed at the root.

In this case, configure the URL path as described in [Modify the monitoring code URL path](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-monitoring-code-source#modify-rum-monitoring-code-url-path "Configure the Real User Monitoring code source in the New RUM Experience to meet your specific requirements.").

### Requests are blocked by infrastructure components

Monitoring code requests may be blocked by infrastructure components such as firewalls and proxies.

Depending on how the component is configured, it is often possible to prevent the requests from being blocked by choosing a different [configuration for the monitoring code source](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-monitoring-code-source "Configure the Real User Monitoring code source in the New RUM Experience to meet your specific requirements."). Otherwise, ensure that your infrastructure allows monitoring code requests to pass; see [Firewall constraints for RUM](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/rum-firewall-latest "Find out how to make sure that Real User Monitoring data passes through your firewall.").

## Verify that RUM beacons are being sent to Dynatrace

The RUM JavaScript sends beacons containing captured data to the [beacon endpoint](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-beacon-endpoint "Learn how to configure the beacon endpoint for web frontends to meet your specific requirements."). By default, the beacon endpoint for an auto-injected frontend is the OneAgent that instruments the web or app server hosting the application. If the New RUM Experience is active, beacons in a new format are sent alongside RUM Classic beacons to the same endpoint.

To identify RUM beacons in your browser's developer tools, look for requests where the last URL path segment has the prefix `rb_`. Beacons in the new format include the query string parameter `pv=4`.

![RUM beacons in the new format](https://dt-cdn.net/images/rum-beacon-new-format-1410-749d442eca.png)

### No beacons being sent

If the browser developer tools don't show any beacons, check the following aspects of your setup:

* If you enabled [data-collection and opt-in mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/additional-configuration/data-privacy-web#data-collection-and-opt-in-mode "Learn about the available settings that help you ensure your web frontends comply with data privacy regulations.") during setup, your code needs to call [`dtrum.enable()`ï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/doc/javascriptapi/doc/types/dtrum.html#enable) from the JavaScript API after the user accepts your data privacy policy. Only then will the RUM JavaScript begin sending data.
* If you selected the snippet format [inline code](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/snippet-formats#inline-code "Learn how to select the format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case in the New RUM Experience."), your browser's console may display a CSP rule violation indicating that an inline script was blocked. In this case, adjust your CSP rules as described in [Allow the execution of inline code](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/adapt-csp-rules#allow-the-execution-of-inline-code "Learn how to adapt your CSP rules for the New RUM Experience.").

### Beacons blocked due to CSP rule violations

If you see CSP rule violations in the console indicating that a connection to the beacon endpoint was blocked, adjust the CSP rules in your application. For details, see [Allow sending RUM beacons](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/adapt-csp-rules#allow-sending-rum-beacons "Learn how to adapt your CSP rules for the New RUM Experience.").

### No application deployed at the root

When OneAgent handles RUM beacons, they are often [sent to the root of the web or app server](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-beacon-endpoint#default-endpoint-auto-injection "Learn how to configure the beacon endpoint for web frontends to meet your specific requirements."). These requests may return response codes such as `404 Not Found` or `503 Service Unavailable` if no application is deployed at the root.

In this case, configure the URL path as described in [Modify the beacon endpoint URL path](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-beacon-endpoint#modify-beacon-endpoint-url-path "Learn how to configure the beacon endpoint for web frontends to meet your specific requirements.").

### Requests are blocked by infrastructure components

Beacon requests may be blocked by infrastructure components such as firewalls and proxies. You can determine where a beacon request was handled by looking at the response bodyâbeacon requests that failed at the beacon endpoint return a JSON response containing the fields `status`, `handler`, `errorCode`, and `errorReason`, while beacons intercepted by a firewall or similar component do not include this JSON response.

Depending on the configuration of these components, you can often ensure that requests reach the beacon endpoint by selecting a different [beacon endpoint configuration](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-monitoring-code-source "Configure the Real User Monitoring code source in the New RUM Experience to meet your specific requirements."). Otherwise, ensure that your infrastructure allows RUM beacons to pass; see [Firewall constraints for RUM](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/rum-firewall-latest "Find out how to make sure that Real User Monitoring data passes through your firewall.").

# Roll out RUM selectively for your frontends in the New RUM Experience

# Roll out RUM selectively for your frontends in the New RUM Experience

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Updated on Jan 07, 2026

The following instructions use the RUM enablement setting at the frontend level. While the [RUM enablement setting at the process group level](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/rum-for-process-groups "Learn how to configure Real User Monitoring for process groups."), in principle, also allows for implementing a selective RUM rollout approach, this tends to be complex and error-proneâparticularly in multi-tier environments. For this reason, we recommend using the frontend-level setting instead.

After deploying OneAgent in full-stack monitoring mode on a host, web applications running on that host are, by default, automatically monitored using RUM. This means that the RUM JavaScript is injected into web pages, and RUM-specific headers and cookies are added to both HTTP requests and responses. Unless you've already defined frontend detection rules that apply to these web applications, the captured RUM data is associated with a catch-all frontend that, by default, has the name **My web application**.

However, there may be cases where you prefer to roll out RUM in a more selective or phased manner after deploying OneAgent. The steps for doing this depend on whether your environment has already captured RUM data or not. The following sections guide you through both scenarios.

## If your environment has already captured RUM data

If your environment has already captured RUM dataâeven if itâs exclusively RUM Classic so farâperform the following actions to implement a selective RUM rollout.

[![Step 1](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-1-086e22066c.svg "Step 1")

**Identify your catch-all frontend**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/selective-rum-rollout#method-1-identify-your-catch-all-frontend "Learn how to roll out RUM selectively for your frontends after installing OneAgent on your hosts.")[![Step 2](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-2-1a1384627e.svg "Step 2")

**Move relevant traffic out of your catch-all frontend**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/selective-rum-rollout#method-1-move-relevant-data-out-of-your-catch-all-frontend "Learn how to roll out RUM selectively for your frontends after installing OneAgent on your hosts.")

[![Step 3](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-3-350cf6c19a.svg "Step 3")

**Disable RUM in advance before you deploy OneAgent**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/selective-rum-rollout#method-1-disable-rum-before-deploying-oneagent "Learn how to roll out RUM selectively for your frontends after installing OneAgent on your hosts.")[![Step 4 optional](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dotted-step-4-2b9147df5b.svg "Step 4 optional")

**Roll out RUM for a frontend**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/selective-rum-rollout#method-1-roll-out-rum-for-a-frontend "Learn how to roll out RUM selectively for your frontends after installing OneAgent on your hosts.")

### Step 1 Identify your catch-all frontend

To identify your catch-all frontend

1. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** > **Overview**.
2. Select  **Web** to view all web frontends.
3. In the frontend list, look for **My web application**, which is the default name for the catch-all frontend.
4. If you can't find it, someone might have renamed it. To locate it, enter the ID `EA7C4B59F27D43EB` in the  **Search frontends** field.

### Step 2 Move relevant traffic out of your catch-all frontend

To implement a phased RUM rollout, it's essential that your catch-all frontend does not contain any relevant traffic and disabling it is safe. You can achieve this by moving any relevant traffic into one or more dedicated frontends, as described in [Set up an auto-injected frontend in the New RUM Experience](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/set-up-auto-injected-frontend "Learn how to set up an auto-injected web frontend in the New RUM Experience."). If you haven't enabled the New RUM Experience for your catch-all frontend yet, examine the captured data in RUM Classic.

Ensure that your frontend detection rules use patterns that are specific enough to distinguish between frontends. For example, if you create a detection rule for `www.example.com`, using a broader pattern like `example.com` may be too generalâespecially if all your companyâs application domains end with `example.com`. In this case, `www.example.com` would be a more precise and appropriate choice.

### Step 3 Disable RUM in advance before you deploy OneAgent

To disable RUM in advance for all web applications running on hosts where OneAgent has not yet been deployed

1. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** > **Overview**.
2. Select  **Web** to view all web frontends.
3. Select your catch-all application.
4. On the **Settings** tab, select **Enablement and cost control**.
5. Turn off **RUM Classic**. This disables both RUM Classic and the New RUM Experience.
6. Select **Save**.

### Step 4 optional Roll out RUM for a frontend Optional

When you are ready to roll out RUM for a frontend, define a new RUM frontend and frontend detection rules, as described in [Set up an auto-injected frontend in the New RUM Experience](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/set-up-auto-injected-frontend "Learn how to set up an auto-injected web frontend in the New RUM Experience."). As already recommended in step 2, choose patterns that are specific enough to distinguish between frontends.

## If your environment has not captured RUM data yet

If your environment has not captured RUM data yet, perform the following actions to implement a selective RUM rollout.

[![Step 1](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-1-086e22066c.svg "Step 1")

**Disable RUM in advance before you deploy OneAgent**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/selective-rum-rollout#method-2-disable-rum-before-deploying-oneagent "Learn how to roll out RUM selectively for your frontends after installing OneAgent on your hosts.")[![Step 2 optional](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dotted-step-2-8ae6982454.svg "Step 2 optional")

**Roll out RUM for a frontend**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/selective-rum-rollout#method-2-roll-out-rum-for-a-frontend "Learn how to roll out RUM selectively for your frontends after installing OneAgent on your hosts.")

### Step 1 Disable RUM in advance before you deploy OneAgent

To disable RUM in advance for all web applications running on hosts where OneAgent has not yet been deployed

1. Go to ![Settings](https://dt-cdn.net/images/settings-icon-256-38e1321b51.webp "Settings") **Settings** > **Collect and capture** > **Real User Monitoring** > **Traffic and cost control** > **Web frontends**.
2. Turn off **Enable Real User Monitoring Classic**. This disables both RUM Classic and the New RUM Experience.
3. Select **Save changes**.

### Step 2 optional Roll out RUM for a frontend Optional

When you are ready to roll out RUM for a frontend, define a new frontend and frontend detection rules, as described in [Set up an auto-injected frontend in the New RUM Experience](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/set-up-auto-injected-frontend "Learn how to set up an auto-injected web frontend in the New RUM Experience.").

Ensure that your frontend detection rules use patterns that are specific enough to distinguish between frontends. For example, if you create a detection rule for `www.example.com`, using a broader pattern like `example.com` may be too generalâespecially if all your companyâs application domains end with `example.com`. In this case, `www.example.com` would be a more precise and appropriate choice.

To enable RUM for your newly created frontend

1. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** > **Overview**.
2. Select  **Web** to view all web frontends.
3. Select your catch-all application.
4. On the **Settings** tab, select **Enablement and cost control**.
5. Turn on **RUM Classic** and **RUM**.
6. Select **Save**.

# Set up agentless RUM in the New RUM Experience

# Set up agentless RUM in the New RUM Experience

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Updated on Feb 03, 2026

As covered in [Find the suitable instrumentation approach](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup#find-suitable-instrumentation-approach "Learn how to set up the New RUM Experience for web frontends."), agentless RUM is the appropriate choice for scenarios where:

* You donât have access to the web server, or your technology doesnât support automatic injection.
* You do have access to the application code.

Once youâve confirmed these conditions, follow the steps below to set up agentless RUM.

[![Step 1](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-1-086e22066c.svg "Step 1")

**Create a frontend**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/set-up-agentless-monitoring#create-frontend "Learn how to set up agentless RUM for your web frontends in the New RUM Experience.")[![Step 2 optional](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dotted-step-2-8ae6982454.svg "Step 2 optional")

**Select and configure the snippet format**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/set-up-agentless-monitoring#select-snippet-format "Learn how to set up agentless RUM for your web frontends in the New RUM Experience.")[![Step 3](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-3-350cf6c19a.svg "Step 3")

**Insert the RUM JavaScript**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/set-up-agentless-monitoring#insert-rum-javascript "Learn how to set up agentless RUM for your web frontends in the New RUM Experience.")[![Step 4](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-4-3f89d67d41.svg "Step 4")

**Verify your setup**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/set-up-agentless-monitoring#verify-setup "Learn how to set up agentless RUM for your web frontends in the New RUM Experience.")[![Step 5](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-5-2de312b50f.svg "Step 5")

**Keep the RUM JavaScript up-to-date**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/set-up-agentless-monitoring#keep-rum-javascript-up-to-date "Learn how to set up agentless RUM for your web frontends in the New RUM Experience.")

## Step 1 Create a frontend

To create a frontend for agentless RUM

1. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** > **Overview**.
2. Select  **Frontend** to start the **Frontend creation** flow.
3. In the **Start monitoring** step, select the frontend type **Web** and provide a frontend name.
4. In the **Select instrumentation method** step, select **Agentless**.
5. Select **Create**.
6. In the **Setup** step, check under **Select capability and settings** if **RUM** is enabled. If it isnât enabled, select  **Override** and turn it on.
7. If you want to capture [user interactions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/user-interactions "Learn how to capture and analyze user interactions.") such as clicks and scrolls, enable **User Interactions**.
8. To ensure compliance with applicable data privacy regulations, configure the required settings under **End users' data privacy**. For more information about the available options, see [Configure data privacy settings for web frontends](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/additional-configuration/data-privacy-web "Learn about the available settings that help you ensure your web frontends comply with data privacy regulations.").
9. Under **Copy JavaScript tag**, select  to copy the RUM JavaScript to the clipboard.

The provided RUM JavaScript has the [JavaScript tag snippet format](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/snippet-formats#js-tag "Learn how to select the format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case in the New RUM Experience."). This format is recommended for most scenarios because it ensures automatic updates. With this snippet, the monitoring code loads and executes synchronously.

## Step 2 optional Select and configure the snippet format Optional

The New RUM Experience provides several snippet formats to meet different requirements. For details on the available formats and their configurability, see [Select a snippet format in the New RUM Experience](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/snippet-formats "Learn how to select the format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case in the New RUM Experience."). For each snippet format, an [API endpoint](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/rum-manual-insertion-tags "Learn how you can download the RUM manual insertion tags via API") is available.

To get the different snippet formats in the UI

1. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** > **Overview**.
2. Select  **Web** to view all web frontends.
3. Select the frontend you want to instrument.
4. On the **Settings** tab, select **Manual insertion**.
5. Scroll to the section for the snippet format you want to use. Then select  to copy the RUM JavaScript to the clipboard.

## Step 3 Insert the RUM JavaScript

Add the RUM JavaScript to the `<head>` element of every HTML page you want to monitor, and make sure itâs the first executable script on the page.

The example below shows a simple HTML page before and after inserting the RUM JavaScript.

Before insertion

After insertion

```
<!DOCTYPE html>



<html  lang="en">



<head>



<meta charset="UTF-8">



<title>MyApp</title>



<script type="text/javascript" src="myapp.js"></script>



</head>



<body>



<form>



Username: <input type="text" name="username"/><br/>



Password: <input type="password" name="password"/><br/>



<input type="submit" value="Login">



</form>



</body>



</html>



</html>
```

```
<!DOCTYPE html>



<html  lang="en">



<head>



<meta charset="UTF-8">



<title>MyApp</title>



<script type="text/javascript" src="https://js-cdn.dynatrace.com/jstag/145e12d594f/cg36988wxq/477g8ec68708x5c1_complete.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>



<script type="text/javascript" src="myapp.js"></script>



</head>



<body>



<form>



Username: <input type="text" name="username"/><br/>



Password: <input type="password" name="password"/><br/>



<input type="submit" value="Login">



</form>



</body>



</html>
```

### Use of template files

For websites that use frameworks or systems with templating, you can usually add custom JavaScript to all pages by placing it in a shared template fileâcommonly named `header.html` or similar. These files are typically included automatically in every page during server-side rendering or static site generation. If your site architecture supports centralized templates, use this approach to insert the RUM JavaScript snippet.

### Use of tag managers

When using tag managers, it can be difficult to guarantee that the RUM JavaScript is the first executable script on the page. If you cannot ensure this, you may lose informationâsuch as certain timings or user eventsâthat are only available when both the RUM monitoring code and the configuration are fully loaded and initialized.

This constraint is more pronounced if you configure the **script execution** option of the [JavaScript tag](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/snippet-formats#js-tag "Learn how to select the format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case in the New RUM Experience."), [OneAgent JavaScript tag](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/snippet-formats#oneagent-js-tag "Learn how to select the format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case in the New RUM Experience."), or [OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/snippet-formats#oneagent-js-tag-sri "Learn how to select the format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case in the New RUM Experience.") to **async** or **defer**.

## Step 4 Verify your setup

If your frontend is receiving traffic, the charts in [![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/experience-vitals "The Experience Vitals app provides an entry point for monitoring web and mobile frontends.") should begin showing data within ten minutes.

If no data appears yet, your environment may require further configuration steps. The guide [Finalize the initial setup for your agentless frontend](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/finalize-initial-setup-agentless "Verify and complete the initial setup for your agentless frontend.") provides a series of checks to help you identify the configuration needed.

## Step 5 Keep the RUM JavaScript up-to-date

If you inserted the RUM JavaScript using the [JavaScript tag](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats#js-tag "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case") snippet format, the monitoring code and configuration update automatically. For other snippet formats, you need to update the RUM JavaScript whenever the configuration changes.

The recommended approach is to integrate the snippet insertion into your build process using the [RUM manual insertion tags API](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/rum-manual-insertion-tags "Learn how you can download the RUM manual insertion tags via API"). This ensures your application consistently runs with the latest configuration.

As explained in [Find the suitable instrumentation approach](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup#find-suitable-instrumentation-approach "Learn how to set up the New RUM Experience for web frontends."), automatic injection is available if at least one application tier can be instrumented with OneAgent, and automatic RUM injection is supported for that technology. For details, see [Technology support - Real User Monitoring - Web servers and applications](/docs/ingest-from/technology-support#rum-auto-injection "Find technical details related to Dynatrace support for specific platforms and development frameworks."). This guide explains how to create a frontend in the New RUM Experience and configure frontend detection rules to ensure captured data is routed to the correct frontend.

**Verify your setup**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/set-up-auto-injected-frontend#verify-setup "Learn how to set up an auto-injected web frontend in the New RUM Experience.")

## Step 1 Deploy OneAgent

After deploying OneAgent in full-stack monitoring mode on your application tiers, the RUM JavaScript is automatically injected into HTML pages. Restart the process after OneAgent deployment for the injection to become active. For installation details, see [Dynatrace OneAgent](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-oneagent "Understand the important concepts related to OneAgent and find out how to install and operate OneAgent on different platforms.").

If OneAgent doesn't inject the RUM JavaScript, refer to [Configure automatic injection in the New RUM Experience](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-auto-injection "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your frontends in the New RUM Experience.") for guidance.

By default, all captured RUM data is associated with the catch-all frontend **My web application**. We recommend keeping this name to make it easier to distinguish from other frontends.

What can I do if I can't find My web application?

If you canât find **My web application**, it may have been renamed.

To locate the renamed **My web application**

1. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** > **Overview**.
2. Select  **Web** to view all web frontends.
3. Select any auto-injected frontend.
4. On the **Settings** tab, select **Frontend detection**.
5. Select the link **catch-all frontend**. You'll be redirected to **My web application**.

## Step 2 Learn how frontend detection rules are applied

Frontend detection rules are evaluated on the server side of your application by the OneAgent on the first instrumented tierâthe one closest to the browser.

All frontend detection rules are URL-based and consist of a pattern and a matcher. There are two ways to define them:

* **On the entire URL:** You can use the matchers **URL starts with**, **URL ends with**, **URL contains**, and **URL equals**. The URL follows the format `scheme://host:port/path?query`, where the query string is optional and default ports (`80` for HTTP and `443` for HTTPS) are omitted. The URL does not include a fragment identifier (as in `scheme://host:port/path?query#fragment`), because fragments are only used by the browser and never sent to the server.
* **On the domain only:** The rule is applied to the host portion of the URL. The matchers **Domain (host) starts with**, **Domain (host) ends with**, **Domain (host) contains**, **Domain (host) equals**, and **Domain (host) matches** are available. When using the latter, the pattern `example.com` matches both `example.com` and `shop.example.com`.

## Step 3 Account for uninstrumented components

There may be a componentâsuch as a reverse proxy or load balancerâbetween the browser and the tier responsible for frontend detection that is either uninstrumented or uses a technology without RUM support. If this component rewrites the URL, the URL used for frontend detection differs from the one originally requested by the browser. In such cases, special considerations are required to ensure that your frontend detection rules take effect as expected.

* If the component terminates HTTPS, you cannot use the `https` scheme in the pattern of a frontend detection rule.
* If the component rewrites the host part of the URL, you can still use the original host in your frontend detection rules. However, you may need to set up host name determination for this to work. For details, see [Set up host name determination in the New RUM Experience](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/set-up-host-name-determination "Learn how to set up host name determination in the New RUM Experience.").
* If the component rewrites the URL path and removes part of it, you cannot use that removed part in your frontend detection rules.

## Step 4 Create a frontend and define frontend detection rules

With the foundational knowledge from the previous steps, you are now ready to create a frontend and define its detection rules.

To create an auto-injected frontend

1. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** > **Overview**.
2. Select  **Frontend** to start the **Frontend creation** flow.
3. In the **Start monitoring** step, select the frontend type **Web** and provide a frontend name.
4. In the **Select instrumentation method** step, select **OneAgent injection**.
5. Select **Create**.
6. In the **Setup** > **Configure frontend detection rule** step, configure the matcher and the pattern for your frontend detection rule.
7. Select **Save frontend detection rule**.
8. Under **Select capability and settings**, check if **RUM** is enabled. If it isnât, select  **Override** and turn it on.
9. If you want to capture [user interactions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/user-interactions "Learn how to capture and analyze user interactions.") such as clicks and scrolls, enable **User Interactions**.
10. To ensure compliance with applicable data privacy regulations, configure the required settings under **End users' data privacy**. For more information about the available options, see [Configure data privacy settings for web frontends](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/additional-configuration/data-privacy-web "Learn about the available settings that help you ensure your web frontends comply with data privacy regulations.").
11. Select **Next** > **Go to new frontend**.

Youâll now see the detection rule for the frontend you just created. To add additional rules, select  **Add**.

You can create up to 1,000 frontend detection rules per environment.

## Step 5 Set the order of frontend detection rules

Frontend detection rules have a defined order, and OneAgent applies them sequentially. Rules at the top of the list take precedence over those further down. To ensure accurate detection, place more specific rulesâfor example, those that include both a domain and a pathâhigher in the list than generic rulesâsuch as those that include only the domain.

The rules you created in the previous step are added to the bottom of the list, so you may need to move them up for them to take effect. To adjust the order, go to ![Settings](https://dt-cdn.net/images/settings-icon-256-38e1321b51.webp "Settings") **Settings** > **Collect and capture** > **Real User Monitoring** > **Frontend** > **Application detection**. Select and hold ![Drag handle](https://dt-cdn.net/images/drag-handle-turquoise-600-1aa0e5ea00.svg "Drag handle") next to the rule name, then drag the rule up or down to change its priority.

How quickly do frontend detection rule changes take effect?

When you update your frontend detection rules, the changes are usually communicated to OneAgent within a minute. However, there are scenarios where the updated rules cannot take effect immediately.

When OneAgent injects the RUM JavaScript, it adds an ID for the detected frontend to the injected snippet. This ID is then included when the RUM JavaScript reports the captured user events, allowing the events to be correctly attributed to the corresponding frontend. In the following situations, OneAgent cannot perform a fresh injection with an updated ID, which delays the effectiveness of rule changes:

* **HTML served through a CDN or other cache:** OneAgent can inject the RUM JavaScript only when the HTML code is evicted from the cache and requested again from the instrumented origin server.
* **Long expiration times for HTML documents:** If the application specifies a long expiration time using the `Expires` response header or the `max-age` directive of the `Cache-Control` header, changes to frontend detection rules cannot take effect until the cached document expires.
* **Single-page applications (SPAs):** SPAs rewrite the current page dynamically instead of loading a new page from the server. If the HTML was loaded before the rule changes, the categorization of captured user events does not reflect the updated configuration, which takes effect as soon as the page is refreshed.

## Step 6 optional Configure the RUM JavaScript snippet format Optional

By default, OneAgent injects the [OneAgent JavaScript tag](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/snippet-formats#oneagent-js-tag "Learn how to select the format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case in the New RUM Experience.") snippet format, which is recommended for most scenarios.

The New RUM Experience provides snippet formats tailored to different requirements. For details on different formats and their configuration options, see [Select a snippet format in the New RUM Experience](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/snippet-formats "Learn how to select the format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case in the New RUM Experience."). You can configure the snippet format as described in [Configure automatic injection in the New RUM Experience](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-auto-injection#configure-snippet-format "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your frontends in the New RUM Experience.").

## Step 7 Verify your setup

If your frontend is receiving traffic, the charts in [![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/experience-vitals "The Experience Vitals app provides an entry point for monitoring web and mobile frontends.") should begin showing data within ten minutes.

If no data appears yet, your environment may require further configuration steps. The guide [Finalize the initial setup for your auto-injected frontend](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/finalize-initial-setup-auto-injection "Verify and complete the initial setup for your auto-injected frontend.") provides a series of checks to help you identify the configuration needed.

# Set up host name determination in the New RUM Experience

# Set up host name determination in the New RUM Experience

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Updated on Jan 08, 2026

The host portion of the URL is essential for two specific RUM featuresâapplying [frontend detection rules](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/set-up-auto-injected-frontend "Learn how to set up an auto-injected web frontend in the New RUM Experience.") and automatically detecting the RUM cookie domain. However, in environments with components like reverse proxies or load balancers, the original host may be rewritten before reaching an instrumented tier using a [technology with RUM support](/docs/ingest-from/technology-support#rum-auto-injection "Find technical details related to Dynatrace support for specific platforms and development frameworks."). To resolve this, OneAgent provides a host name determination feature.

## Add a host name determination header

Components like reverse proxies and load balancers can be configured to forward the original host information to the backend in a request header. Common headers for this purpose include [`X-Forwarded-Host`ï»¿](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-Host) and the standardized [`Forwarded`ï»¿](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Forwarded) header.
OneAgent can retrieve the original host from one of these headers or from any proprietary header that follows the same format as `X-Forwarded-Host`: `<host>` for default ports or `<host>:<port>` otherwise. A comma-separated list of such entries is also supported, with the assumption that the first entry represents the original host name.

Some components add one of these headers by default. If yours does not, you need to configure it to include such a header to use the host name determination feature.

## Configure host name determination

OneAgent uses a list of request headers to determine the host name. Headers in the list are processed in order, with those at the top taking precedence. As soon as OneAgent finds a matching header on the request, it stops evaluating the remaining headers. After confirming that your uninstrumented component adds a suitable header, you might need to add that header to the list.

To configure the headers used for host name determination

1. Go to ![Settings](https://dt-cdn.net/images/settings-icon-256-38e1321b51.webp "Settings") **Settings** > **Collect and capture** > **Real User Monitoring** > **Frontend** > **Host name determination**.
2. If the header added by your component is missing from the list, select **Add HTTP header** and enter the header name.
3. You can reorder entries by selecting and holding ![Drag handle](https://dt-cdn.net/images/drag-handle-turquoise-600-1aa0e5ea00.svg "Drag handle") next to the header name, then dragging it up or down. Ensure the new entry appears above the `Host` header, which is included in every HTTP/1.1 request.

## Example

If the original host name requested by the browser is `www.example.com` and your uninstrumented reverse proxy forwards the request to an internal host such as `backend.com`, the original host information is lost. In this case, the proxy must add a header that preserves the original host name to allow OneAgent to determine the original host, as illustrated in the diagram below.

# Select a snippet format in the New RUM Experience

# Select a snippet format in the New RUM Experience

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Updated on Jan 08, 2026

The RUM JavaScriptâwhether [automatically injected](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/set-up-auto-injected-frontend "Learn how to set up an auto-injected web frontend in the New RUM Experience.") or [manually inserted](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/set-up-agentless-monitoring "Learn how to set up agentless RUM for your web frontends in the New RUM Experience.") into your web applicationâconsists of two key components:

* **Monitoring code**: The JavaScript code that provides RUM capabilities such as capturing user events.
* **Configuration**: The application configuration that is initially used by the monitoring code. It is updated later via the RUM beacon response in case of configuration changes.

The New RUM Experience provides several snippet formats that integrate these components into your pages in different ways, each tailored to meet specific requirements.

This page [offers guidance](#snippet-format-recommendations) to help you choose the snippet format that best meets your requirements, followed by a [detailed description of each format](#snippet-format-details).

## Recommendations for selecting the snippet format

For most use cases, we recommend the following:

* Use the [JavaScript Tag](#js-tag) for manual insertion.
* Use the [OneAgent JavaScript Tag](#oneagent-js-tag) for automatic injection.

If you want to leverage the subresource integrity (SRI) browser feature to ensure that the monitoring code hasn't been altered, use [OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI](#oneagent-js-tag-sri) for manual insertion and automatic injection.

To avoid parse-blocking execution of the monitoring code, configure the **script execution** option of your selected snippet format to **async** or **defer**. Instructions for configuring this option are provided in the documentation for each individual snippet format below. Keep in mind that while the monitoring code is not yet fully loaded and initialized, certain timings and user events will be lost.

## Available snippet formats

Below, you'll find all snippet formats available in the New RUM Experience, along with their configuration options. Note that both the New RUM Experience and RUM Classic use the same RUM JavaScript snippet. When the New RUM Experience is enabled, the monitoring code includes additional modules, and the snippet contains extended configuration. However, the underlying snippet remains shared. As a result, any changes you make to the settings described below for the New RUM Experience also apply to RUM Classic.

JavaScript tag

OneAgent JavaScript tag

OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI

Inline code

**JavaScript tag** links to an external file that includes both the monitoring code and the configuration. JavaScript tag is only available for manual insertion.

[Get JavaScript tag via API](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/rum-manual-insertion-tags/get-javascript-tag)

##### Updates

The short cache duration used for the external file ensures regular automatic updates, making JavaScript tag an ideal choice if you don't want to take care of updating the inserted snippet after configuration changes.

##### Monitoring code source

The external file is loaded from the Dynatrace CDN.

##### Cache duration

The external file containing monitoring code and configuration is updated according to its cache duration, which is one hour by default and can be configured. The available values are lowâa few hours or daysâto ensure the configuration is updated regularly. The cache duration specifies how long browsers can cache the file. The Dynatrace CDN caches it for one hour.

To configure the cache duration

1. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** > **Overview**.
2. Select  **Web** to view all web frontends.
3. Select the frontend you want to configure.
4. On the **Settings** tab, select **Manual insertion**.
5. In the **JavaScript tag** section, use the dropdown under **Cache monitoring code and configuration for** to select the required cache duration.

##### Script execution

By default, the monitoring code is loaded and executed synchronously by the browser. To avoid parse-blocking behavior, you can configure the addition of the `async` or `defer` attributes.

* With the `async` attribute, the monitoring code is loaded in parallel with page parsing and executed immediately once itâs available.
* With the `defer` attribute, the monitoring code is also loaded in parallel, but execution is deferred until after the page has finished parsing.

With both attributes, certain timings and user events will be lost while the monitoring code is not yet fully loaded and initialized.

To configure script execution

1. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** > **Overview**.
2. Select  **Web** to view all web frontends.
3. Select the frontend you want to configure.
4. On the **Settings** tab, select **Manual insertion**.
5. In the **JavaScript tag** section, set **Script execution attribute** to **async**, **defer**, or **No attribute**.
6. Copy the snippet and insert it into your page.

When fetching the JavaScript tag via the API, you can control script execution by passing a parameter. For details, see [GET JavaScript tag](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/rum-manual-insertion-tags/get-javascript-tag "Retrieve the most recent JavaScript tag for manual insertion.").

##### Addition of the `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute

ð¢ Enabled by default

The external script referenced by JavaScript tag is served from the Dynatrace CDN, resulting in a cross-origin request. To enable the collection of detailed JavaScript error messages and W3C resource timings, you need to include the `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute in the script tag.

To enable the addition of the `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute

1. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** > **Overview**.
2. Select  **Web** to view all web frontends.
3. Select the frontend you want to configure.
4. On the **Settings** tab, select **Manual insertion**.
5. In the **JavaScript tag** section, enable **Add crossorigin=anonymous attribute**.
6. Copy the snippet and insert it into your page.

When fetching the JavaScript tag via the API, you can control the addition of the `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute by passing a parameter. For details, see [GET JavaScript tag](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/rum-manual-insertion-tags/get-javascript-tag "Retrieve the most recent JavaScript tag for manual insertion.").

**OneAgent JavaScript tag** includes the configuration and links to an external file containing the monitoring code. It's available for both manual insertion and automatic injection.

[Get OneAgent JavaScript tag via API](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/rum-manual-insertion-tags/get-oneagent-javascript-tag)

##### Updates

When inserting the OneAgent JavaScript tag manually, it must also be manually updated whenever configuration changes occur. To ensure it remains current, we recommend using it together with fully automated updates via the API. Using OneAgent JavaScript tag from the web UI is discouraged unless timely configuration updates are not critical.

In case of automatic injection, OneAgent always injects the OneAgent JavaScript tag using the current configuration. Note, however, that the caching policy of your application may influence how often OneAgent gets a chance to inject. For more information, see [Cache control header optimizations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/rum-injection#cache-header-optimization "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your applications").

##### Monitoring code source

In case of agentless monitoring, the monitoring code is delivered by the Dynatrace CDN. In case of automatic injection or [manual insertion for pages of an auto-injected application](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/rum-injection#manual-insertion-using-oneagent "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your applications"), the file is, by default, delivered by the OneAgent that instruments your application. Alternatively, it is also possible to load it from the Dynatrace CDN; for details, see [Request the monitoring code from the Dynatrace CDN](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/configure-monitoring-code-source#request-rum-monitoring-code-from-cdn "Configure the Real User Monitoring code source for your specific requirements.").

##### Cache duration

Both browsers and the Dynatrace CDN can cache the monitoring code for up to a year. This extended cache duration is made possible by embedding both the RUM JavaScript version and a hash of the active modules in the file URL.

##### Script execution

By default, the monitoring code is loaded and executed synchronously by the browser. To avoid parse-blocking behavior, you can configure the addition of the `async` or `defer` attributes.

* With the `async` attribute, the monitoring code is loaded in parallel with page parsing and executed immediately once itâs available.
* With the `defer` attribute, the monitoring code is also loaded in parallel, but execution is deferred until after the page has finished parsing.

With both attributes, certain timings and user events will be lost while the monitoring code is not yet fully loaded and initialized.

To configure script execution for automatic injection

For details, see [GET OneAgent JavaScript tag](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/rum-manual-insertion-tags/get-oneagent-javascript-tag "Retrieve the most recent OneAgent JavaScript tag for manual insertion.").

**OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI** lets you take advantage of the subresource integrity (SRI) browser feature to ensure that the monitoring code hasn't been altered, see [Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) in the New RUM Experience](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/subresource-integrity "Use the Subresource Integrity (SRI) browser feature in the New RUM Experience to ensure the integrity of Real User Monitoring code."). It includes configuration, a reference to an external file containing the monitoring code, and an integrity hash for this monitoring code. It is supported for both automatic injection and manual insertion.

[Get OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI via API](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/rum-manual-insertion-tags/get-oneagent-javascript-tag-with-sri)

##### Updates

When inserting the OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI manually, it must also be manually updated whenever configuration changes occur. To ensure it remains current, we recommend using it together with fully automated updates via the API.

5. In the **OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI** section, set **Script execution attribute** to **async**, **defer** or **No attribute**.
6. Copy the snippet and insert it into your page.

When fetching the OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI via the API, you can control script execution by passing a parameter. For details, see [GET OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/rum-manual-insertion-tags/get-oneagent-javascript-tag-with-sri "Retrieve the most recent OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI for manual insertion.").

**Inline code** contains both the configuration and the RUM monitoring code, keeping the number of web requests at a minimum. Note that the Session Replay Classic monitoring code is not inlined, so there will still be an additional request if you use Session Replay Classic. If your website consists of many individual pages, using inline code may not be beneficial, as it increases the size of each document. However, it can be a suitable choice for single-page applications (SPAs).

[Get inline code via API](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/rum-manual-insertion-tags/get-inline-code)

##### Updates

When inserting the inline code manually, it must also be manually updated whenever configuration changes occur. To ensure it remains current, we recommend using it together with fully automated updates via the API. Using inline code from the web UI is discouraged unless timely configuration updates are not critical.

In case of automatic injection, OneAgent always injects the inline code using the current configuration. Note, however, that the caching policy of your application may influence how often OneAgent gets a chance to inject. For more information, see [Cache control header optimizations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/rum-injection#cache-header-optimization "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your applications").

##### Monitoring code source

In case of agentless monitoring, the Session Replay Classic monitoring code is delivered by the Dynatrace CDN. In case of automatic injection or [manual insertion for pages of an auto-injected application](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/rum-injection#manual-insertion-using-oneagent "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your applications"), it is, by default, delivered by the OneAgent that instruments your application. Alternatively, it is also possible to load it from the Dynatrace CDN, see [Request the monitoring code from the Dynatrace CDN](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/configure-monitoring-code-source#request-rum-monitoring-code-from-cdn "Configure the Real User Monitoring code source for your specific requirements.").

##### Cache duration

Because the RUM monitoring code is inlined, its cache duration matches that of your page, which is determined by the cache settings on your web server. The Session Replay Classic monitoring code can be cached for up to a year by both browsers and the Dynatrace CDN. This extended cache duration is made possible by embedding the RUM JavaScript version in the file URL.

##### Script execution

The monitoring code is loaded and evaluated synchronously by the browser.

# Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) in the New RUM Experience

# Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) in the New RUM Experience

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Updated on Jan 07, 2026

Integrating third-party resources into web pages, such as those from a content delivery network (CDN), poses the risk that an attacker could potentially gain control of the third-party host and manipulate these resources. The [Subresource Integrity (SRI)ï»¿](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) browser feature mitigates this risk by ensuring that only unaltered resources are used. It does this by including a cryptographic hash that the fetched resource must match.

Dynatrace RUM supports SRI through a dedicated snippet format, [OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/snippet-formats#oneagent-js-tag-sri "Learn how to select the format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case in the New RUM Experience."). This contains a cryptographic hash for the RUM monitoring code. If the cryptographic hash doesn't match the monitoring code received by the browser, the code won't be executed.

If Session Replay Classic is enabled, the Session Replay Classic monitoring code is injected into your page by the RUM JavaScript as an external resource, resulting in a separate request. When you use the OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI, the RUM JavaScript injects both the Session Replay monitoring code and a cryptographic hash to ensure its integrity.

SRI is not supported for the snippet format JavaScript tag due to its incompatibility with the dynamic update mechanism inherent to this format.

## Auto-injected frontend Configure an auto-injected frontend to use SRI

Note that all connected ActiveGates must be on ActiveGate version 1.310+ for at least 30 days before this feature becomes available.

For auto-injected frontends, the Real User Monitoring code is, by default, delivered by OneAgent. To use SRI, you need to [configure your frontend to request the monitoring code from the Dynatrace CDN](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-monitoring-code-source#request-rum-monitoring-code-from-cdn "Configure the Real User Monitoring code source in the New RUM Experience to meet your specific requirements."), which will allow you to select the necessary snippet format.

1. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** > **Overview**.
2. Select  **Web** to view all web frontends.
3. Select the frontend you want to configure.
4. On the **Settings** tab, select **Automatic injection**.
5. Under **Real User Monitoring code source**, select **CDN**.
6. Under **Snippet format**, select **OneAgent JavaScript Tag with SRI**.
7. Select **Save**.

## Agentless frontend Configure an agentless frontend to use SRI

The optimal approach to using SRI for an agentless frontend is to integrate the insertion of the OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI into your build process via the [API](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/rum-manual-insertion-tags/get-oneagent-javascript-tag-with-sri "Retrieve the most recent OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI for manual insertion."). This ensures that your frontend consistently operates with the latest configuration.

To get the OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI from the web UI

1. Go to ![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals** > **Overview**.
2. Select  **Web** to view all web frontends.
3. Select the frontend you want to instrument.
4. On the **Settings** tab, select **Manual insertion**.
5. Scroll to the **OneAgent JavaScript Tag with SRI** section and select  to copy the RUM JavaScript to the clipboard.

We don't recommend using the OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI from the web UI unless timely configuration updates are not critical.

# Initial setup for web frontends

# Initial setup for web frontends

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* 1-min read
* Updated on Feb 03, 2026

Start your journey with the New RUM Experience using the foundational guides in this section, designed to help you achieve a working setup.

## Already using RUM Classic for your web frontends?

Upgrading to the New RUM Experience is straightforward and unlocks enhanced monitoring capabilities.

[Learn more](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/enable-new-rum-for-web-apps)

## Instrument new frontends

To get started monitoring your web frontends with the New RUM Experience, follow the instructions below.

1. Find the suitable instrumentation approach

The New RUM Experience offers two approaches for instrumenting your web frontends: Automatic injection and agentless RUM.

#### Automatic injection

Automatic injection is the most convenient way to instrument your web frontends. To use it, the following prerequisites must be met:

* You can access your web server and install [OneAgent](/docs/platform/oneagent "Learn the monitoring capabilities of OneAgent.").
* At least one of the application tiers involved in delivering the HTML must be instrumented by a OneAgent code module that supports automatic RUM injection. For a list of supported technologies, see [Technology support - Real User Monitoring - Web servers and applications](/docs/ingest-from/technology-support#rum-auto-injection "Find technical details related to Dynatrace support for specific platforms and development frameworks.").

If these conditions are met, we recommend using automatic injection.

If the conditions are met but you prefer to insert the RUM JavaScript manually, create an auto-injected frontend and then follow the instructions in [Use manual insertion for pages of an auto-injected frontend](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/configure-auto-injection#manual-insertion-using-oneagent "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your frontends in the New RUM Experience.").

#### Agentless RUM

If automatic injection isnât feasible, use agentless RUM. This approach only requires access to the applicationâs code, not to the web server. To set up agentless RUM, you need to manually insert the RUM JavaScript into each page of your application.

2. Set up your frontend

Once youâve chosen your instrumentation approach, follow the corresponding guide below to set up your frontend.

[**Set up an auto-injected frontend**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/set-up-auto-injected-frontend "Learn how to set up an auto-injected web frontend in the New RUM Experience.")[**Set up agentless RUM**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/set-up-agentless-monitoring "Learn how to set up agentless RUM for your web frontends in the New RUM Experience.")

3. Finalize your initial setup

Open [![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/experience-vitals "The Experience Vitals app provides an entry point for monitoring web and mobile frontends.") and navigate to the frontend you created. If your frontend is receiving traffic, the charts should begin displaying data within ten minutes. If they donât, your environment may require further configuration steps. The guides below will walk you through verifying and completing your setup.

[**Finalize the initial setup for your auto-injected frontend**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/finalize-initial-setup-auto-injection "Verify and complete the initial setup for your auto-injected frontend.")[**Finalize the initial setup for your agentless frontend**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/finalize-initial-setup-agentless "Verify and complete the initial setup for your agentless frontend.")

## Roll out RUM selectively

After deploying OneAgent in full-stack monitoring mode on a host, web applications running on that host are, by default, automatically monitored using RUM. If you prefer to roll out RUM in a more phased manner after deploying OneAgent, follow the instructions in [Roll out RUM selectively for your frontends in the New RUM Experience](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/web-frontends/initial-setup/selective-rum-rollout "Learn how to roll out RUM selectively for your frontends after installing OneAgent on your hosts.").

# Apdex ratings

# Apdex ratings

* Explanation
* 3-min read
* Updated on Jan 27, 2023

Dynatrace calculates [Apdex ratingsï»¿](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apdex) to provide you with a single metric that tells you about the performance of your application and the errors that impact user experience.

Apdex is calculated for each discrete [user action](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-actions "Learn what user actions are and how they help you understand what users do with your application.") and each application overall. In this way, it provides quick insight into the user experience within your application.

Default Apdex ratings in Dynatrace are based on application-specific thresholds.

| Score | Performance level |
| --- | --- |
| 0.94â1.0 | Excellent |
| 0.85â0.94 | Good |
| 0.7â0.85 | Fair |
| 0.5â0.7 | Poor |
| < 0.5 | Unacceptable |

Apdex ratings can be used as benchmarks for comparing two applications over time, even though the timing thresholds set up for the two applications may be different.

Applications are typically comprised of many different user action types. For example, it might be acceptable to have a complex search that takes up to 6 seconds to complete while the loading of the homepage in the same application might need to take less than 2 seconds to ensure user satisfaction. Such differences can be addressed by configuring different Apdex thresholds for various user action types.

For more details on the Apdex standard, see [Apdex Referencesï»¿](https://www.apdex.org/index.php/documents/).

## Adjust Dynatrace Apdex settings

You can customize Dynatrace Apdex ratings based on the specific requirements of your application. Once configured, they give you a quick and easy way of evaluating the performance of all user actions that you're monitoring: a value of `1.0` is perfect; values below `0.5` are unacceptable. It's recommended that you define appropriate user-satisfaction timing thresholds and error impact configurations for each monitored user action.

You can adjust the Apdex settings for your application and for its key user actions.

### Configure Apdex settings for applications

You can modify the Apdex thresholds for your [web](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/configure-apdex-web "Configure the user-satisfaction performance thresholds for your web application and its key user actions."), [mobile](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-apdex-mobile "Configure the user-satisfaction performance thresholds for your mobile application and its key user actions."), and [custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/additional-configuration/configure-apdex-custom "Configure the user-satisfaction performance thresholds for your custom application and its key user actions.").

### Configure Apdex settings for key user actions

You can also change the Apdex thresholds for a particular key user action for your [web](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/configure-key-user-actions-web "Mark a user action as a key user action and configure Apdex rating for key user actions of your web applications."), [mobile](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-key-user-actions-mobile "Mark a user action as a key user action and configure Apdex rating for key user actions of your mobile applications."), and [custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/additional-configuration/configure-key-user-actions-custom "Mark a user action as a key user action and configure Apdex rating for key user actions of your custom applications.").

## Error impact on Apdex

User actions with JavaScript [errors](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#error "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace.") are rated as **Frustrated**. Sometimes, user actions that are, in fact, fast and below the Apdex threshold are displayed in red and rated as **Frustrated** because some of the user actions have JavaScript errors.

The same is true for request errors. An HTTP response code, CSP violation, or resource request that is configured in settings to be captured as an error leads to a **Frustrated** user action.

You can exclude errors from Apdex calculations. See [Configure error detection for web applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/configure-errors "Configure your application to capture or ignore request, custom, and JavaScript errors."), [Adjust Apdex settings for mobile applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-apdex-mobile "Configure the user-satisfaction performance thresholds for your mobile application and its key user actions."), and [Adjust Apdex settings for custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/additional-configuration/configure-apdex-custom "Configure the user-satisfaction performance thresholds for your custom application and its key user actions.") for more details.

## Apdex-based analysis

Dynatrace makes it easy for you to analyze your application's Apdex from a variety of dimensions. You can check the Apdex rating for a particular user action, location, and application as well as view the Apdex rating for each user action within one user session.

For more details, see [Context-based Apdex analysis](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/apdex-analysis "Check Apdex rating for a user action, location, and application.").

# User action metrics

# User action metrics

* Explanation
* 8-min read
* Updated on Mar 20, 2023

For web applications, Dynatrace calculates a host of [user action](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-actions "Learn what user actions are and how they help you understand what users do with your application.") metrics.

Core web vitals

The following metrics are core web vitals and are available only for load actions:

* **Largest contentful paint**
* **Cumulative layout shift**
* **First input delay**

## Milestone metrics

Milestone metrics represent events that occur at a specific point in time during a user action. However, these metrics are measured in seconds or milliseconds because they are calculated relative to the user action start time. In other words, user action start time serves as a reference point from which the time for the milestone metrics is measured. For example, a value of 47 ms for **Navigation start** indicates that this event occurred 47 ms after the action start time.

Metric

Description

Applicable to

**Navigation start**

The moment when the user agent finishes prompting to unload the previous page  
If there is no previous page, this value is the same as `PerformanceTiming.fetchStart`.

Load actions

**Request start**

The time before the user agent sends the request to obtain the page from the server, relevant application caches, or a local resource  
If the transport layer fails and the connection is reopened, this metric is set to the time corresponding to the new request.

Load actions

XHR actions

**Time to first byte**

The time taken until the first byte of the response is received from the server, relevant application caches, or a local resource

Load actions

XHR actions

**HTML downloaded**

The time taken until the user agent receives the last byte of the response or the transport connection is closed, whichever comes first  
For XHR actions, this metric is known as **Response end**.

Load actions

XHR actions

**DOM interactive**

The time taken until the page's status is set to "interactive" and it's ready to receive input

Load actions

**Speed index**[1](#fn-1-1-def)

The score measuring how quickly the visible parts of the page are rendered

Load actions

**DOM content loaded**

The time taken until the user agent fires the `DOMContentLoaded` event at the page  
The `DOMContentLoaded` event is executed when the basic HTML of the page is loaded and its parsing is complete. The event doesn't wait for the loading of add-ons (for example, stylesheets, sub-frames, and images) to be complete.

Load actions

**First paint**[2](#fn-1-2-def)

The time taken to render the first non-default background element

Load actions

**First contentful paint**[3](#fn-1-3-def)

The time taken to render the first bit of content, such as text or images

Load actions

**Largest contentful paint**[4](#fn-1-4-def)

The time taken to render the largest element in the viewport

Load actions

**Visually complete**[1](#fn-1-1-def)

The time taken to fully render content in the viewport

Load actions

XHR actions

**DOM complete**

The time taken until the page's status is set to "complete"

Load actions

**Load event start**

The time taken to begin the load event of the page

Load actions

**Load event end**

The time taken to complete the load event of the page

Load actions

**User action duration**

The time taken to complete the page load  
This includes load time of XHR requests initiated before `loadEventEnd` and load time of dynamic resources and script executions triggered by DOM modifications.

Load actions

XHR actions

Custom actions

**First input start**

The moment when the user first interacts with a page, for example, clicks a UI control

Load actions

**First input delay**[5](#fn-1-5-def)

The time from the first interaction with the page to when the user agent can respond to that interaction

Load actions

1

**Speed index** and **Visually complete** are only available on browsers that support [mutation observersï»¿](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2012/02/Detect-DOM-changes-with-Mutation-Observers): Microsoft Internet Explorer 11, Microsoft Edge 15+, Firefox 57+, and Google Chrome 61+.

2

**First paint** is supported on all browsers except Internet Explorer.

3

**First contentful paint** is available only for [Chromium-based browsersï»¿](https://www.chromium.org/Home).

4

**Largest contentful paint** is available for Chromium-based browsers. Measured using [Google-provided APIsï»¿](https://web.dev/lcp/#measure-lcp-in-javascript).

5

For Chromium-based browsers, **First input delay** is measured using [Google-provided APIsï»¿](https://web.dev/fid/#measure-fid-in-javascript). For Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer 9+, the metric is measured using a Dynatrace implementation that listens for events of type `click`, `mousedown`, `keydown`, or `touchstart` and calculates the delay from when the RUM JavaScript registers such events to when the events are triggered.

## Phase metrics

As opposed to milestone metrics, phase metrics imply a duration.

Metric

Description

Applicable to

**Blocking**

The time between when the user agent receives a request to download a resource and when it actually starts downloading the resource  
This includes the time spent on waiting for a free TCP socket, generating disk cache entries, and proxy negotiation.

Load actions

**Application cache**

The time spent checking any relevant application caches  
This includes the time before the connection to the server is established.

Load actions

**DNS lookup**

The time taken to resolve the hostname for a target URL

Load actions

**TCP connect**

The time taken to establish a TCP connection to the server (including SSL)

Load actions

**Secure connect**

The time taken to secure the connection established to the server  
This includes the SSL handshake and SOCKS.

Load actions

**Request**

The time taken to request the page from the server until the first byte is received

Load actions

**Response**

The time taken to receive the response

Load actions

**Processing**

The time between DOM loading and Load event start

Load actions

**OnLoad**

The time taken to process the load event

Load actions

**OnDOMContentLoaded**

The time taken to execute `onDomContentLoaded` handlers

Load actions

**Callback**

The time taken to execute XHR callbacks

Load actions

**Redirect time**

The time taken to follow any HTTP redirects

Load actions

**Long tasks**[1](#fn-2-1-def)

The total time of all long JavaScript tasks (over 50 ms)  
The metric is measured from **Navigation start** for the entire user action duration.

Load actions

1

You can use the **Long tasks** metric instead of the [**Total blocking time**ï»¿](https://web.dev/tbt/) metric, which we decided not to introduce due to certain technical limitations. Also note that the **Blocking** metric shown in the waterfall isn't related to **Total blocking time** and is only available for specific requests.

## Key performance metrics

From the metrics listed above, Dynatrace has specified some as key metrics. Key performance metrics enable you to select the ideal user experience metric for each of your applications. These key metrics provide you with valuable performance insights that promote success in your digital business. The key performance metrics include:

* User action duration
* Visually complete
* Speed index
* DOM interactive
* Load event end
* Load event start

* HTML downloaded / Response end
* Time to first byte
* Largest contentful paint
* Cumulative layout shift[1](#fn-3-1-def)
* First input delay (RUM web only)

1

**Cumulative layout shift** is the score measuring the unexpected shifting of visible webpage elements. It is available for [Chromium-based browsersï»¿](https://www.chromium.org/Home) and measured using [Google-provided APIsï»¿](https://web.dev/cls/#measure-cls-in-javascript).

Dynatrace allows you to [choose the right performance metric for each application condition](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/work-with-key-performance-metrics "Learn how to use the right key performance metrics to optimize user experience data for each of your applications.").

## Missing metric measurements

Metric measurements might be missing in the following cases:

#### Visually complete

* During a load action, the user selects another link that triggers a new load action before the original page load event is completed. The second load action interrupts the **Visually complete** calculation of the first load action, so no measurement is available.  
  In the earlier version of **Visually complete**, Dynatrace used the user action duration as a fallback measurement. This skewed the timeseries, so such cases are now excluded to ensure more accurate aggregates.
* A late redirect is triggered immediately following a load action.
* The [Visually complete time-out](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/how-to-use-visually-complete-and-speed-index-metrics#config-enhanced-vc "Learn how to use 'Visually complete' and 'Speed index' metrics.") is reached during the calculation.

#### Core web vitals

* The browser API doesn't trigger and provide a metric measurement before the user action ends (see the **User action duration** metric).  
  In earlier versions of Dynatrace Real User Monitoring, these values were sent after the completion of the user action. Such values were not meaningful and often not representative. For example, **First input delay (FID)** measures page load responsiveness. The primary driver for a high FID value is JavaScript execution. So if a user waited a minute following a page load before selecting a new link, most if not all JavaScript processing would already have taken place and the resulting small FID measurement wouldn't be a representative value of a true page load. Such measurements skewed the overall metric aggregate.
* The user's browser doesn't support the APIs that are used to measure core web vitals. See details under [Milestone metrics](#milestone-metrics) to learn which browsers support Core web vitals.
* The page is loaded or reloaded in an inactive tab, and the browser API does not report values.
* The browser API provides negative values.

# User actions

# User actions

* Explanation
* 12-min read
* Updated on Jul 11, 2024

A user action is an interaction with an end-user interface that involves a call to a web server, which can potentially have multiple nested calls. It is a transformation from one view to another view that is triggered by a user input, for example, a page load, click, or touch.

## User action types for web applications

Web applications

The following types of user actions are available in Dynatrace for [web applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/applications#web "Learn about monitored applications in Real User Monitoring and the different application types supported by Dynatrace."):

* [Load actions](#load-action)
* [XHR actions](#xhr-action)
* [Custom actions](#custom-action)

The key difference among these action types is the way action duration is calculated and the list of available metrics.

### Load actions

A load action is defined as an actual page loading in your browser. If you type a URL in your browser and use **Enter**, a load action occurs. During this action type, many resources are loaded, including images, HTML, and CSS.

#### Load action duration

The action duration is the time required for the complete load action. More specifically, the start time of the user action equals the W3C `navigationStart` time. If this attribute is not available, the start time equals the time when the [RUM JavaScript](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case") is initialized in the browser. The end time is when the last `onload` handler has completed its task. The `onload` handler is an event handler in JavaScript that's used to call the execution of JavaScript after a page, frame, or image has completely loaded. If any [`XMLHttpRequests`](#xhr-action) are started by an `onload` handler, the user action ends when the `XMLHttpRequest` is complete.

![Page load cycle](https://dt-cdn.net/images/pageload-1886-93237e4321.png)

#### Load action timings

The following measures are used to chart the duration of specific steps in the load action process.

### XHR actions

Dynatrace continuously tracks user interactions with each page. If user interaction leads to `XmlHttpRequests` or `fetch()` calls, an XHR action is created. Dynatrace also detects if there are additional XHRs triggered in the callback of the initial XHR and so on. In this case, Dynatrace waits until all requests are finished. By monitoring the DOM, Dynatrace can also identify resources that have been added in the callbacks. Dynatrace then waits until those resources have finished downloading before ending the action.

An XHR action starts with the user's click on a control on a web page. All [metrics](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-action-metrics "Learn what metrics Dynatrace calculates for user actions and find out what each metric indicates.") are calculated in relation to this point in time and are based on the initial XHR that triggers the user action.

By default, RUM captures certain interaction types. You can configure RUM to detect even more interaction types. For details, see [Capture additional interaction types for web applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/capture-interaction-types "Choose which interaction types RUM should detect for your web applications.").

#### XmlHttpRequest

Most modern applications, including single-page applications, rely on a single load action that downloads the framework and initializes the page. After that, the [DOMï»¿](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) of the page is changed via JavaScript, and all communication with the web server is done via [`XmlHttpRequest`](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/configure-dynatrace-real-user-monitoring-to-capture-xhr-actions "Understand why you need to activate specific JavaScript frameworks for XHR-action support and learn how to configure Real User Monitoring for XHR actions.").

![XHR actions](https://dt-cdn.net/images/xhractions-1785-0de9863dfd.png)

#### Fetch API

The [Fetch APIï»¿](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/) provides an interface for fetching resources, including resources across the network. It is similar to `XMLHttpRequest`, but the API provides a more flexible feature set. The generic definitions of `Request`, `Response`, and other network request objects in Fetch allow them to be used at any time they are needed, whether it's for service workers, Cache API, or anything that handles or modifies requests and responses. Fetch also supports the Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

User actions based on the Fetch API appear in Dynatrace as XHR actions. You can configure RUM to [automatically detect and capture Fetch API request information](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/configure-dynatrace-real-user-monitoring-to-capture-xhr-actions "Understand why you need to activate specific JavaScript frameworks for XHR-action support and learn how to configure Real User Monitoring for XHR actions.").

### Custom user actions

Rather than relying on default user action generation, you may want to fine-tune your Real User Monitoring by adding additional user actions directly into your application's HTML. This can be useful if our automated user-action generation doesn't catch specific actions or you want to introduce specific fine-grained timings into your application monitoring. For example, you can measure how long it takes to open a JavaScript-only dropdown menu, or you can measure the duration time of some JavaScript code. To define custom actions, use the [RUM JavaScript API](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/customize-rum "Find out how to customize Real User Monitoring using the JavaScript API.").

## User action duration

Below, you can find information on the maximum user action duration in Dynatrace and the user action contributors for web applications.

### Maximum user action duration

The maximum user action duration depends on the application type.

Web application

Mobile app

Custom app

The maximum duration of a web user action is 3 minutes. When a user action takes longer than this, Dynatrace reports such an action as a 3-minute action.

The maximum duration of a mobile user action depends on the action type.

* **Autogenerated actions**

  By default, the maximum duration of a mobile autogenerated user action is set to 1 minute. You can increase this limit up to 9 minutes, though we don't recommend doing that. For Android, see [Configure user action monitoring](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/monitoring-capabilities#configure-user-action-monitoring "Configure the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin to adjust the monitoring capabilities of OneAgent."); for iOS, use the [`DTXAutoActionMaxDurationMilliseconds` configuration key](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys#user-actions "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.").

  If an autogenerated user action takes longer than the configured maximum duration, such an action is closed and reported to Dynatrace with a duration slightly longer than the configured maximum duration.
* **Custom actions**

  The maximum duration of a mobile custom action is 9 minutes.

  If a custom action takes longer than 9 minutes and is not closed, such an action is discarded and not reported to Dynatrace.

The maximum duration of a user action in custom apps is 10 minutes. When a user action takes longer than this, such an action is discarded and not reported to Dynatrace.

### User action contributors for web applications

The duration of a user action can be broken down into three components:

* **Server time**: The time spent on server-side processing for a page
* **Network time**: The time taken to request and receive resources (including DNS lookup, redirect, and TCP connect time)
* **Frontend time**: The time taken by the browser to render a page

These components contribute to the overall duration of a user action.

The user action duration is calculated as follows.

**User action duration** = (`loadEventEnd` or `endTimeOfLastXHR`) â `actionStart`

In this calculation

actionStart
:   `navigationStart` for page loads or "click time" for XHR actions and user navigations, such as a click on a button or a link

endTimeOfLastXHR
:   When XHR calls are triggered during the process and aren't completed before `loadEventEnd`, then the end time of the last XHR call is used instead of the `loadEventEnd` time.

The user action contributors are calculated as follows.

**Server time** = `responseStart` â `requestStart`

**Network time** = (`requestStart` â `actionStart`) + (`responseEnd` â `responseStart`)

**Frontend time** = `User action duration` â `Server time` â `Network time`

View the examples of user action contributors below.

![Application overview](https://dt-cdn.net/images/appoverview-1789-db21269b45.png)

## User action naming rules

Many applications allow users to accomplish the same goal using different UI controls and following different paths. When monitoring such applications, it can be difficult to differentiate between actions that have the same result and goal but are executed using different parts of the application UI. Likewise, if the application is translated into multiple languages, the same application function or UI element can appear under varying names. With user action naming rules, Dynatrace can detect such subtle variations and intelligently group user actions that achieve the same goal into logical groups for monitoring.

Dynatrace automatically removes certain common `sessionid` tokens from user action names, for example, `jsessionid` for Java containers, default `sessionid` for PHP, and `CFID` and `CFTOKEN` for ColdFusion. Nonetheless, there are numerous session ID variations that may be present in your environment. If Dynatrace doesn't automatically recognize and remove session IDs from certain user action names you encounter, you'll need to configure custom naming rules for your [web](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/create-custom-names-for-user-actions "Customize automatically generated user action names for your web applications."), [mobile](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/naming-rules-mobile "Customize automatically generated user action names for your mobile applications."), and [custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/additional-configuration/naming-rules-custom "Customize automatically generated user action names for your custom applications.").

When you configure custom naming rules for your web, mobile, and custom applications, remember that your input in the **Add placeholder** and **Add naming rule** sections is case-sensitive. Only the already configured user action name can be set to case-insensitive.

## Child actions

Child actions are actions attached to the main, or parent, user action. You can create child actions for web, mobile, and custom applications.

For web applications, you can create child actions using the RUM JavaScript API, specifically, the [`enterXhrAction`ï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/doc/javascriptapi/doc/types/dtrum.html#enterxhraction) method.

For mobile and custom applications, Dynatrace offers an API method for creating a child action.

[Android SDK](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-oneagent-sdk/oneagent-sdk-for-android#child-actions) [iOS SDK](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/oneagent-sdk-for-ios#create-child-action) [Xamarin](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/cross-platform-frameworks/xamarin-nuget#manual-sub-action) [![.NET MAUI](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dotnetmaui-aea483621e.svg ".NET MAUI").NET MAUI](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/cross-platform-frameworks/maui#manual-sub-action) [Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/dynatrace_flutter_plugin#a-namecustomsubactionacreate-custom-sub-actions) [React Native](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dynatrace/react-native-plugin#create-custom-sub-actions) [OpenKit](/docs/ingest-from/extend-dynatrace/openkit/dynatrace-openkit-api-methods#create-custom-actions) 

The possible child action nesting depends on the application type and technology used.

Web applications

There's no limit on the number of child actions attached to a parent action, and there's no limit on the number of levels.

However, note that child actions are not displayed on the [user session details page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/new-user-sessions#session-details-page "Learn about user session segmentation and filtering attributes."), and child action nesting is not preserved on the [waterfall analysis page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/waterfall-analysis "Learn how to analyze all user action monitoring data through waterfall analysis.") for a parent action to which these child actions are attached.

Android, iOS

There's no limit on the number of child actions attached to a parent action. However, note that you can have only nine levels of child actionsâyou can create one parent action and nine levels of child actions (when child action A is added to a parent action, child action B is added to child action A, child action C is added to child action B, and so on). Also, refer to [User session structure for individual user](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-session#session-structure-dep-on-app-type "Learn how a user session is defined, when a user session starts or ends, how user session duration is calculated, and more.").

Child actions are not displayed on the [user session details page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/new-user-sessions#session-details-page "Learn about user session segmentation and filtering attributes."), but you can view them on the [waterfall analysis page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/waterfall-analysis "Learn how to analyze all user action monitoring data through waterfall analysis.") for a parent action to which these child actions are attached. Even though the child action nesting is not fully preserved in the waterfall analysis view and all child actions are displayed as child actions of level 1, you can still grasp the action nesting from the timings.

Flutter, React Native, Xamarin, .NET MAUI, OpenKit

There's no limit on the number of child actions attached to a custom action. However, note that you can have only one level of child actionsâyou can't create a child action for another child action (child actions can't have their own child actions). Also, refer to [User session structure for individual user](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-session#session-structure-dep-on-app-type "Learn how a user session is defined, when a user session starts or ends, how user session duration is calculated, and more.").

Child actions are not displayed on the [user session details page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/new-user-sessions#session-details-page "Learn about user session segmentation and filtering attributes."), but you can view them on the [waterfall analysis page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/waterfall-analysis "Learn how to analyze all user action monitoring data through waterfall analysis.") for a custom action to which these child actions are attached.

## Key user actions

Most applications include user actions that are particularly important to the success of your digital business. Examples of these actions are signups, checkouts, and product searches. Such key user actions might take longer to execute than others, or they might have the requirement to be of a shorter-than-average duration.

For instance, consider that you've set your global [Apdex threshold](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/scores-and-ratings/apdex-ratings "Learn how Dynatrace uses Apdex to measure user satisfaction with application performance.") to 3 seconds. While this threshold might be acceptable for the majority of user actions, it might not be acceptable for a signup user action. Alternatively, there could be a search action that is quite complex and requires more time than the allotted 3 seconds.

You can mark a user action as a key user action and configure Apdex rating for key user actions in your [web](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/configure-key-user-actions-web "Mark a user action as a key user action and configure Apdex rating for key user actions of your web applications."), [mobile](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-key-user-actions-mobile "Mark a user action as a key user action and configure Apdex rating for key user actions of your mobile applications."), and [custom application](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/additional-configuration/configure-key-user-actions-custom "Mark a user action as a key user action and configure Apdex rating for key user actions of your custom applications.") settings.

# User and error events

# User and error events

* Explanation
* 6-min read
* Updated on Apr 16, 2024

Besides detecting [user actions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-actions "Learn what user actions are and how they help you understand what users do with your application."), Dynatrace also captures additional events known as user events and error events. These events occur within a [user session](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-session "Learn how a user session is defined, when a user session starts or ends, how user session duration is calculated, and more."), but they're not directly generated via user interaction with UI controls.

## User events

User events are page changes, rage clicks, rage taps, and user tagging events.

### Page change

A page change event signifies that a user has navigated to a different page on a website. For example, if you navigated to a website "payment" page, the user session would show the following events.

* `Load: loading of page /payment`
* `Page change: /payment`

For more details, see [RUM web: Page change events](/docs/whats-new/saas/sprint-218#page-change "Release notes for Dynatrace SaaS, version 1.218") and [Pages and page groups](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/pages-and-pagegroups "Learn how to use and define pages and page groups in Dynatrace Real User Monitoring.").

### Rage event

When your application doesn't respond quickly or there's a user interface issue, users might repeatedly click the screen or a UI control in frustration. Dynatrace detects such behavior as a rage event: a rage click for a web application and a rage tap for a mobile application.

Three or more rapid clicks or taps within the same area are considered to be a rage event. Rage events commonly reflect slow load times or failed resources. Detected rage events affect the [user experience score](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/scores-and-ratings/user-experience-score "User experience score is a metric used to categorize user sessions as Frustrating, Tolerable, or Satisfying."), but when required, you can choose to exclude rage clicks and rage taps from score calculation. See [Configure user experience score thresholds](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/scores-and-ratings/user-experience-score#configure "User experience score is a metric used to categorize user sessions as Frustrating, Tolerable, or Satisfying.") to learn more.

You also have the option to completely disable rage event detection.

* Web applications In your application settings, select **Behavior analytics** > **Usability analytics** and turn off **Detect rage clicks**.
* Android See [Rage tap detection](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/monitoring-capabilities#rage-tap-detection "Configure the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin to adjust the monitoring capabilities of OneAgent.").
* iOS Set the `DTXDetectRageTaps` [configuration key](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/ios-configuration-keys#user-actions "With configuration keys, you can fine-tune the auto-instrumentation of your iOS apps.") to `false`.

In Dynatrace, you can also [check sessions with rage events](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/new-user-sessions#rage-events "Learn about user session segmentation and filtering attributes.") to view the details of a rage click or rage tap event.

See also [Discover frustrating user experiences with automatic rage click detectionï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/news/blog/discover-frustrating-user-experiences-with-automatic-rage-click-detection/).

### User tagging

One of the key features of Real User Monitoring is the ability to uniquely identify individual users across different browsers, devices, and user sessions. This is achieved by assigning a user tag, which is comprised of a username, nickname, or email, to a user session. When a user is tagged in your application, Dynatrace reports a user tagging event.

You can tag users when they log in or when an already logged-in session is used or restored upon application relaunch, as the user tag isn't persisted when the application restarts.

For web applications, you can [set up user tagging](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/identify-individual-users-for-session-analysis "Tag individual users via the JavaScript API for session analysis.") using either the RUM JavaScript API or your application's page metadata.

For mobile and custom applications, Dynatrace offers a variant of a "user tagging" method.

[Android SDK](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-oneagent-sdk/oneagent-sdk-for-android#tag-specific-users) [iOS SDK](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/oneagent-sdk-for-ios#tag-specific-users) [Cordova](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dynatrace/cordova-plugin#identify-user) [Xamarin](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/cross-platform-frameworks/xamarin-nuget#identify-user) [![.NET MAUI](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dotnetmaui-aea483621e.svg ".NET MAUI").NET MAUI](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/cross-platform-frameworks/maui#identify-user) [Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/dynatrace_flutter_plugin#identifyUser) [React Native](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dynatrace/react-native-plugin#identify-a-user) [OpenKit](/docs/ingest-from/extend-dynatrace/openkit/dynatrace-openkit-api-methods#tag-specific-users) 

With user tags, you can analyze a specific user's behavior and experience via user session analysis. See [Focus on sessions of an individual user](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/new-user-sessions#individual-user "Learn about user session segmentation and filtering attributes.") and [User details](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/analyze-all-sessions-of-a-single-user "Learn about user behavior by analyzing the user profile (user experience score) and session activity.") for more information.

## Error events

Error events include errors and crashes.

Source maps and symbol files

To help you identify the origin of detected JavaScript errors and mobile crashes in your code, Dynatrace uses source maps and symbol files. See [Source map support for JavaScript error analysis](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/source-map-support-for-javascript-error-analysis "Learn how source maps make it easy to analyze, reproduce, and fix JavaScript errors.") for web applications and [Upload and manage symbol files for mobile applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/analyze-and-use/upload-and-manage-symbol-files "Learn about deobfuscation (Android) and symbolication (iOS and tvOS) and your options for uploading and managing symbol files in Dynatrace.").

### Error

Dynatrace reports an error whenever a browser throws a JavaScript exception, a web request results in an error, a custom error is sent via API, and for other reasons.

The following error types are captured depending on your application type.

| Error type | Description | Web | Mobile | Custom |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Request error | Detected by the browser and OneAgent on your servers | Applicable | Applicable | Applicable |
| Reported error | Manually reported via dedicated "report an error" API method | Not applicable | Applicable | Applicable |
| Custom error | Manually reported via the RUM JavaScript API | Applicable | Not applicable | Not applicable |
| JavaScript error | JavaScript exceptions thrown by the browser | Applicable | Not applicable | Not applicable |

To report a custom error for a web application or a reported error for a mobile or a custom application, use a dedicated API method.

[Web](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/doc/javascriptapi/doc/types/dtrum.html#reportcustomerror) [Android SDK](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-oneagent-sdk/oneagent-sdk-for-android#report-errors) [iOS SDK](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/oneagent-sdk-for-ios#report-error) [Cordova](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dynatrace/cordova-plugin#report-error) [Xamarin](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/cross-platform-frameworks/xamarin-nuget#report-errors) [![.NET MAUI](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dotnetmaui-aea483621e.svg ".NET MAUI").NET MAUI](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/cross-platform-frameworks/maui#report-errors) [Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/dynatrace_flutter_plugin#reportValues) [React Native](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dynatrace/react-native-plugin#report-values) [OpenKit](/docs/ingest-from/extend-dynatrace/openkit/dynatrace-openkit-api-methods#report-errors) 

Dynatrace offers numerous configuration options related to errors. For web applications, you can [fine-tune error detection for each error type](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/configure-errors "Configure your application to capture or ignore request, custom, and JavaScript errors."), for example, configure request error rules, add custom error rules, or ignore JavaScript errors. For [mobile](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/web-request-errors-mobile "Stop treating certain response HTTP codes as errors for your mobile applications.") and [custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/additional-configuration/web-request-errors-custom "Stop treating certain HTTP response codes as errors for your custom applications."), you can opt to ignore web request errors.

Note that errors affect both the [user experience score](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/scores-and-ratings/user-experience-score "User experience score is a metric used to categorize user sessions as Frustrating, Tolerable, or Satisfying.") and [Apdex rating](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/scores-and-ratings/apdex-ratings "Learn how Dynatrace uses Apdex to measure user satisfaction with application performance."). However, you can [change user experience score thresholds](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/scores-and-ratings/user-experience-score#configure "User experience score is a metric used to categorize user sessions as Frustrating, Tolerable, or Satisfying."), [adjust Apdex settings](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/scores-and-ratings/apdex-ratings#adjust-apdex "Learn how Dynatrace uses Apdex to measure user satisfaction with application performance."), and [exclude errors from Apdex calculations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/scores-and-ratings/apdex-ratings#error-impact "Learn how Dynatrace uses Apdex to measure user satisfaction with application performance.") in your application settings.

You can leverage performance, multidimensional, and user session analysis to get information on errors that occur in your application. You can check various error details such as the estimated error count, provider, technology, and more. For details, see the following pages.

* [Performance analysis | Top errors](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/performance-analysis#top-errors "Understand the available types of performance analysis that are provided by Dynatrace.")
* [Multidimensional analysis based on error type](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/multi-dimensional-analysis#by-error-type "Find out how Dynatrace Real User Monitoring enables you to dig deep into your user actions and perform analysis across numerous dimensions.")
* [Analyze individual user actions | Errors](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/analyze-individual-user-actions#errors "Understand how you can access user action detail pages and analyze user actions.")
* [User session analysis | View error details](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/new-user-sessions#errors "Learn about user session segmentation and filtering attributes.")

### Crash

Mobile and custom applications

When your application crashes, Dynatrace automatically reports a crash event. Dynatrace captures crashes and sends the crash report to the server. The crash report includes the occurrence time and the full stack trace of the exception.

For custom applications, Dynatrace doesn't automatically report crashes. You need to [manually report them](/docs/ingest-from/extend-dynatrace/openkit/dynatrace-openkit-api-methods#report-crash "Read how Dynatrace OpenKit can be used from the developer's point of view.").

In Dynatrace, a crash is a fatal issue that terminates the application. Non-fatal issues, such as caught exceptions and [errors](#error), are not counted as crashes. ANRs (Application Not Responding) are not monitored by Dynatrace.

Some crashes might not be reported, as when the application user experiences network issues like an unstable or unavailable internet connection. This is because Dynatrace doesn't send crash reports that are older than 10 minutes (as such reports can no longer be correlated on the Dynatrace Cluster).

#### Disable crash reporting

Crash reporting is enabled by default, but you can deactivate this feature.

* Android See details for [Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-plugin/monitoring-capabilities#crash-reporting "Configure the Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin to adjust the monitoring capabilities of OneAgent.") or [OneAgent SDK for Android](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/instrumentation-via-oneagent-sdk/oneagent-sdk-for-android#crash-reporting "Learn how to enrich mobile user experience monitoring in Android using OneAgent SDK.").
* iOS See [Crash reporting](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/instrumentation/ios-auto-instrumentation-features#crashes "Explore the list of features that are available after you instrument your application with OneAgent.").
* Cross-platform frameworks Adjust the configuration file (`dynatrace.config.<extension>`) by adding the `crashReporting false` (Android) or `"DTXCrashReportingEnabled": false` (iOS) line. Note that this only disables monitoring of the native crashes.

  See details for the following frameworks.

  [Cordova](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dynatrace/cordova-plugin#2-configuration-with-dynatrace) [Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/dynatrace_flutter_plugin#configurationStructure) [React Native](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dynatrace/react-native-plugin#structure-of-the-dynatracejs-file) [Xamarin](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/cross-platform-frameworks/xamarin-nuget#config-file) [![.NET MAUI](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dotnetmaui-aea483621e.svg ".NET MAUI").NET MAUI](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/cross-platform-frameworks/maui#config-file)

#### Report a crash manually

For some technologies, you can report a crash manually.

[Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/dynatrace_flutter_plugin#crashReporting) [React Native](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dynatrace/react-native-plugin#manually-report-a-crash) [Xamarin](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/cross-platform-frameworks/xamarin-nuget#report-crash) [![.NET MAUI](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dotnetmaui-aea483621e.svg ".NET MAUI").NET MAUI](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/cross-platform-frameworks/maui#report-crash) [OpenKit](/docs/ingest-from/extend-dynatrace/openkit/dynatrace-openkit-api-methods#report-crash) 

#### Analyze and use crash data

To view the complete sequence of user actions that preceded a crash, leverage user session analysis. You can also open a crash report to get all the code-level information and quickly trace the root cause of a crash. For additional details, see the following pages.

* [User session analysis | Examine crashes](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/new-user-sessions#crashes "Learn about user session segmentation and filtering attributes.")
* [View crash reports for mobile applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/analyze-and-use/crash-reports-mobile "Check the latest crash reports for your mobile applications.")
* [View crash reports for custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/analyze-and-use/crash-reports-custom "Check the latest crash reports for your custom applications.")

With Session Replay on crashes, you receive additional context for your crash analysis. You can watch video-like screen recordings that replay the user actions immediately preceding a detected crash. This feature is available for [Android](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-replay/session-replay-android "Set up Session Replay for your Android apps to learn which actions your users perform.") and [iOS](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-replay/session-replay-ios "Prerequisites and the procedure for enabling Session Replay for your iOS apps.").

Note that crashes drastically affect the [user experience score](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/scores-and-ratings/user-experience-score "User experience score is a metric used to categorize user sessions as Frustrating, Tolerable, or Satisfying."). See [Calculate the user experience score](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/scores-and-ratings/user-experience-score#calculate "User experience score is a metric used to categorize user sessions as Frustrating, Tolerable, or Satisfying.") to see why crashed sessions are usually rated as **Frustrating**.

# Configure Session Replay for Android

# Configure Session Replay for Android

* How-to guide
* 7-min read
* Updated on Oct 07, 2025

This page describes how to enable and customize Session Replay for your Android apps.

## Full Session Replay

[Session Replay](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-replay "Learn how you can use Session Replay to better understand and troubleshoot errors experienced by your customers.") on Android enables you to capture your customers' interactions with your mobile application and replay each tap, swipe, screen rotation in a movie-like experience.

## Session Replay on crashes

Additionally, you can use it to get additional context for crash analysis in the form of video-like screen recordings that replay the user actions preceding a detected [crash](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#crash "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace.")

## Prerequisites

Make sure that your system meets the following requirements:

* Dynatrace version 1.303
* OneAgent for Android version 8.303
* Real User Monitoring enabled for your application
* Active Dynatrace Digital Experience Monitoring license
* The web UI URL has a trusted certificate

## Supported technologies and known limitations

* Android 5.0+ (API level 21+) is supported.
* Android Gradle plugin 7.0+ is supported.
* Kotlin version 1.9+ is supported.

  + Kotlin version 1.8 supported because of Kotlin compatibility
* Jetpack Compose version 1.4+ is supported starting with OneAgent for Android version 8.325.
* Session Replay is not available for cross-platform frameworks such as Cordova, React Native, Flutter, Xamarin, and more
* For a hybrid app, Session Replay is supported only for the native part of the app. Session Replay is not supported for the browser part of a hybrid app.
* Only AndroidX support libraries are supported. Classes such as Activity or Fragment in com.android.support are not supported.
* We recommend not using other crash reporting tools together with Dynatrace Session Replay.
* Session Replay can capture only certain events. However, if you need to track a specific view or event that is not supported by default, you can [capture a custom event](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-replay/session-replay-android#capture-custom-events "Set up Session Replay for your Android apps to learn which actions your users perform.").
* You can play back the user sessions recorded with Session Replay only in [certain browsers](/docs/discover-dynatrace/get-started/dynatrace-ui/dynatrace-web-ui-requirements#session-replay "Find out which browsers Dynatrace applications can run on.").
* See [Technical restrictions for Session Replay for web applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-replay/session-replay-restrictions-web "Learn which restrictions apply to Session Replay.") for more information.

Session Replay is a video-like reconstruction of the user interaction with mobile application, that uses captured events and data. Because of this approach replayed session can differ from the actual user experience. Known issues

* Fragments with in-out animations can cause problems, especially when animations are short.
* Floating action buttons can cause data masking issues.
* The inputType attribute within the Button component might result in buttons appearing without text when captured.

## Enable Session Replay on Android

If you haven't done so already, complete all steps described in the instrumentation wizard.

1. Go to **Mobile**.
2. Select the mobile application that you want to configure.
3. Select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit** in the upper-right corner of the tile with your application name.
4. From the application settings, select **General** > **Enablement and cost control**.
5. Turn on **Enable Full Session Replay** or **Enable Session Replay on crashes**. You have the following options:

   * Enabling Full Mobile Session Replay on 100%, all sessions will be captured
   * Enabling Full Mobile Session Replay on lower than 100%, randomly selected session will be captured
   * Enabling Session Replay on Crashes means guarantees that, regardless of the Enable Full Session Replay setting and its const and traffic control value, all sessions with crash are will be captured.
6. From the application settings, select **Instrumentation wizard**, and then select **Android** or **iOS**.
7. Follow the steps in the instrumentation wizard.

For Android Gradle plugin versions 4.0 and 4.1, you need to change the compile option to Java 8. This can be done during the instrumentation wizard step called **Apply the Dynatrace plugin and add the plugin configuration**. Add the following code to the top-level build file:

```
compileOptions {



sourceCompatibility 1.8



targetCompatibility 1.8



}
```

For Android Gradle plugin 4.2+, Java 8 is used by default, so no configuration change is needed.

## Mask sensitive data

### Data masking levels

Session Replay on comes with three predefined masking levels:

* **Safest**âall the editable text fields, images, labels, web views, and switches are masked.
* **Safe**âall the editable text fields are masked.
* **Custom**âby default, masks the same elements as **Safest**, but you can decide exactly which application components or views should be masked. See [Configure custom masking](#custom-masking) for details.

### Change masking level

By default, OneAgent applies the **Safest** masking level. To change it to the **Safe** or **Custom** level, use the API to configure OneAgent. If you've opted for the **Custom** level, see [Configure custom masking](#custom-masking) for details on how to set which application components or views should be masked.

#### Example 1: Change masking level to Safe

Use the following code to set the masking level to Safe.

```
MaskingConfiguration config = new MaskingConfiguration.Safe();



// .Safest or .Custom



DynatraceSessionReplay.setConfiguration(Configuration.builder()



.withMaskingConfiguration(config)



.build());
```

#### Example 2: Change masking level to Custom

Use the following code to set the masking level to Custom. For additional options, see [Configure custom masking](#custom-masking).

```
MaskingConfiguration config = new MaskingConfiguration.Custom();



// .Safest or .Safe



DynatraceSessionReplay.setConfiguration(Configuration.builder()



.withMaskingConfiguration(config)



.build());
```

#### Example 3: Change masking level to Custom and remove all masked views

Use the following code to set the masking level to Custom and remove all masked views (removeAllMaskedViews). For additional options, see [Configure custom masking](#custom-masking).

```
MaskingConfiguration config = new MaskingConfiguration.Custom().removeAllMaskedViews();



DynatraceSessionReplay.setConfiguration(Configuration.builder()



.withMaskingConfiguration(config)



.build());
```

### Configure custom masking

If you set the [data masking level](#masking-levels) to **Custom**, you can use additional API methods to decide which application components or views should be masked. You can:

* [Mask views](#mask-views).
* [Mask views using android:tag](#mask-views-android-tag).
* [Mask views using a masking tag](#mask-views-masking-tag).
* [Mask Jetpack Compose composables](#mask-jc-composables).

#### Mask views

You can enable or disable masking globally or for the selected components, such as text fields, images, labels, web views, and switches.

```
Set&lt;Class<? extends View&gt;> set = new HashSet&lt;Class<? extends View&gt;>()\\{{



add(ImageView.class);



add(WebView.class);



}};



new MaskingConfiguration.Custom().addMaskedView(ImageView.class); // Adds one masked view



new MaskingConfiguration.Custom().addMaskedViews(set); // Adds all masked views



new MaskingConfiguration.Custom().removeMaskedView(ImageView.class); // Removes one masked view



new MaskingConfiguration.Custom().removeAllMaskedViews(); // Removes all masked views
```

You need to apply the custom masking configuration for it to take effect. See [Change masking level to Custom and remove all masked views](#change-masking-level-custom-remove-all-masked-views) for the example code snippet.

#### Mask views using `android:tag`

You can also enable or disable masking of the selected views based on their `android:tag`.

```
Set&lt;Integer&gt; set = new HashSet&lt;Integer&gt;()\\{{



add(R.id.view_id1);



add(R.id.view_id2);



}};



new MaskingConfiguration.Custom().addMaskedIds(set);



new MaskingConfiguration.Custom().addNonMaskedIds(set);



new MaskingConfiguration.Custom().removeMaskedIds(set);



new MaskingConfiguration.Custom().removeNonMaskedIds(set);
```

You need to apply the custom masking configuration for it to take effect. See [Change masking level to Custom and remove all masked views](#change-masking-level-custom-remove-all-masked-views) for the example code snippet.

#### Mask views using a masking tag

You can also mask a view by adding the `data-dtrum-mask` masking tag to the view's `android:tag`. A view with this masking tag is always masked.

#### Mask Jetpack Compose composables

Jetpack Compose provides manual masking functionality that allows you to control which composables are masked in Session Replay. To mask a composable, use the `dynatraceSessionReplayMasked` modifier.

```
import com.dynatrace.android.api.dynatraceSessionReplayMasked



@Composable



fun MyScreen() {



Column {



Text(



text = "This text will be masked",



modifier = Modifier.dynatraceSessionReplayMasked()



)



}



}
```

## Enable Session Replay logs

You can enable Session Replay logs the same way as for OneAgent. See [Enable debug logging for Dynatrace Android Gradle plugin or OneAgent SDK](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-android-app/debug-logging-oneagent "Activate the debug logs from OneAgent.") for more information.

## Capture custom events

Session Replay records only certain events. However, you can track an event that is not supported by default.

```
DynatraceSessionReplay.trackCustomEvent("User logged")
```

## Change transmission mode to Wi-Fi for images

By default, all dataâinformation on captured events and imagesâis sent over any connection. However, you can opt to transfer images only when the users are connected to Wi-Fi to save their mobile data.

```
DynatraceSessionReplay.setConfiguration(



Configuration.builder()



.withDataTransmissionMode(DataTransmissionMode.NOT_METERED_NETWORK)



.build()



)
```

# Configure Session Replay for iOS

# Configure Session Replay for iOS

* How-to guide
* 8-min read
* Updated on Sep 25, 2025

This page describes how to enable and customize Session Replay for your iOS apps.

OneAgent for iOS version 8.323 or later is required for applications compiled with Xcode 26.

## Full Session Replay

[Session Replay](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-replay "Learn how you can use Session Replay to better understand and troubleshoot errors experienced by your customers.") on iOS enables you to capture your customers' interactions with your mobile and replay each tap, swipe, screen rotation in a movie-like experience.

## Session Replay on crashes

Additionally, you can use it to get more context for crash analysis in the form of video-like screen recordings that replay the user actions preceding a detected [crash](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#crash "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace.").

## Prerequisites

Make sure that your system meets the following requirements:

* Dynatrace version 1.303
* OneAgent for iOS version 8.323
* Real User Monitoring enabled for your application
* Active Dynatrace Digital Experience Monitoring license
* The web UI URL has a trusted certificate

## Known limitations and issues

### Technical limitations

* iOS 12.0+ is supported.
* Swift 5+
* Xcode 15+
* SwiftUI is supported.
* Session Replay is not available for tvOS and iPadOS.
* Session Replay is not available for cross-platform frameworks such as Cordova, React Native, Flutter, Xamarin, and similar.
* For a hybrid app, Session Replay is supported only for the native part of the app. For the browser part, Session Replay only supports webpage load events.
* We recommend not using other crash reporting tools together with Dynatrace Session Replay.
* Session Replay can capture only certain events. However, if you need to track a specific view or event that is not supported by default, you can [capture a custom event](#capture-custom-events).
* You can only play back the user sessions recorded with Session Replay in [certain browsers](/docs/discover-dynatrace/get-started/dynatrace-ui/dynatrace-web-ui-requirements#session-replay "Find out which browsers Dynatrace applications can run on.").
* For iOS 26 applications generated with Xcode 26, masking functionality is only available with OneAgent for iOS version 8.323+.

See [Technical restrictions for Session Replay for web applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-replay/session-replay-restrictions-web "Learn which restrictions apply to Session Replay.") for more information.

Session Replay is a video-like reconstruction of the user interactions with mobile applications that use captured events and data. Because of this approach, replayed sessions can differ from the actual user experience. Known issues

## Enable Session Replay on iOS

If you haven't done so already, complete all steps described in the instrumentation wizard.

1. Go to **Mobile**.
2. Select the mobile application that you want to configure.
3. Select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit** in the upper-right corner of the tile with your application name
4. From the application settings, select **General** > **Enablement and cost control**.
5. Turn on **Enable Full Session Replay** and/or **Enable Session Replay on crashes**. You have the following options:

   * Enabling Full Mobile Session Replay on 100%, all sessions will be captured
   * Enabling Full Mobile Session Replay on less than 100%, randomly selected session will be captured
   * Enabling Session Replay on Crashes guarantees that, regardless of the Enable Full Session Replay setting and its const and traffic control value, all sessions with crash will be captured
6. From the application settings, select **Instrumentation wizard**, and then select **Android** or **iOS**.
7. Follow the steps in the instrumentation wizard.

## Mask sensitive data

### Data masking levels

Session Replay on comes with three predefined masking levels:

* **Safest**âall the editable text fields, images, labels, web views, and switches are masked.
* **Safe**âall the editable text fields are masked.
* **Custom**âby default, masks the same elements as **Safest**, but you can decide exactly which application components or views should be masked. See [Configure custom masking](#custom-masking) for details.

### Change masking level

By default, OneAgent applies the **Safest** masking level. To change it to the **Safe** or **Custom** level, use the API to configure OneAgent. If you've opted for the **Custom** level, see [Configure custom masking](#custom-masking) for details on how to set which application components or views should be masked.

#### Example 1: Change masking level to Safe

Use the following code to set the masking level to Safe.

```
let maskingConfiguration = MaskingConfiguration(maskingLevelType: .safe)



try? AgentManager.setMaskingConfiguration(maskingConfiguration)
```

### Configure custom masking

If you set the [data masking level](#data-masking-levels) to **Custom**, you can use additional API methods to decide which application components or views should be masked. You can:

* [Enable or disable masking rules](#enable-disable-masking-rules).
* [Mask views using accessibilityIdentifier](#mask-views-accessibilityIdentifier).
* [Mask views using a masking tag](#mask-views-masking-tag).

#### Enable or disable masking rules

You can enable or disable rules globally or for the selected components, such as text fields, images, labels, web views, and switches.

```
try? maskingConfiguration.add(rule: .maskAllImages) // Adds one rule



try? maskingConfiguration.remove(rule: .maskAllSwitches) // Removes one rule



try? maskingConfiguration.addAllRules() // Adds all rules



try? maskingConfiguration.removeAllRules() // Removes all rules
```

If you remove all masking rules, Session Replay won't mask anything. If you enable all masking rules, it's equivalent to the Safest masking level.

#### Mask views using accessibilityIdentifier

You can enable or disable masking of the selected views based on their accessibilityIdentifier.

```
try? maskingConfiguration.addMaskedView(viewIds: \["masked_view_id"\])



try? maskingConfiguration.removeMaskedView(viewIds: \["masked_view_id"\])



try? maskingConfiguration.addNonMaskedView(viewIds: \["nonMasked_view_id"\])



try? maskingConfiguration.removeNonMaskedView(viewIds: \["nonMasked_view_id"\])
```

#### Mask views using a masking tag

You can also mask a view by adding the data-dtrum-mask masking tag to the view's accessibilityIdentifier. A view with this masking tag is always masked.

## Enable Session Replay logs

You can enable Session Replay logs the same way as for OneAgent. See [OneAgent for iOS debug logging](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/instrument-ios-app/customization/logging-for-ios "Turn on debug logging for OneAgent.") for more information

## Capture custom events

Session Replay records only certain events. You can additionally capture custom events that are not supported by default. You can capture a custom event with an included screenshot of a specific view, specific screen region, or full screen

All methods for capturing custom events can throw a TrackCustomEventError.notInMainThread error if you try to capture a custom event from a thread that is not the main thread. We suggest that you include a do-catch clause until everything works properly; then you can replace the clause with a simpler version that, even in case of an error, just doesn't capture the custom event

```
do {



try AgentManager.trackCustomEvent(name: "my_event_name", view: nil)



} catch {



print(error)



}
```

### Specific view

Capture a custom event with a screenshot of the specific view

```
try? AgentManager.trackCustomEvent(name: "my_view_name", view: myView)
```

### Specific screen region

Capture a custom event with a screenshot of the specific screen region

```
try? AgentManager.trackCustomEvent(name: "my_view_name", frame: anyFrame)
```

### Full screen

Capture a custom event with a screenshot of the full screen

```
try? AgentManager.trackCustomEvent(name: "my_view_name")
```

## Change transmission mode to Wi-Fi for images

By default, all dataâinformation on captured events and imagesâis sent over any connection. However, you can opt to transfer images only when the users are connected to Wi-Fi to save their mobile data

```
AgentManager.setTransmissionMode(.wifi) // .data by default
```

## Screenshot debugger

The Session Replay screenshot debugger allows you to see when the screenshots are taken, which parts of the screen are captured, and what dataâtext fields, images, labels, web views, and togglesâis masked

You can use the Session Replay screenshot debugger when running your mobile app in the simulator, so you don't have to wait until the session is closed and uploaded to Dynatrace.

![Screenshot debugger](https://dt-cdn.net/images/session-replay-screenshot-debugger-25-62c2c0bcf4.gif)

After you enable the Session Replay screenshot debugger, you can see the corresponding keys in your project. Note that these keys are not sent to the app code for release or archive compilations, so they are never included in the production code. These keys are used only for debug runs.

![Screenshot debugger](https://dt-cdn.net/images/xcode-936-179db4b123.webp)

To enable the Session Replay screenshot debugger:

1. In Xcode, select **Edit Scheme** from the Scheme menu to change your application scheme
2. From your application scheme settings, select the **Run** action, and then switch to the **Arguments** tab
3. Under Environment Variables, add one or both of the following keys

   * **DTXDebugMasking**. This key shows screenshots taken by Session Replay, including masked content and UI controls. For each captured screenshot, you see a brief flash
   * **DTXDebugFrameHighlight**. This key highlights the captured part of the screen with a red frame so that you can know exactly what part of the screen is captured

# Session Replay

# Session Replay

* Overview
* 3-min read
* Updated on Jan 27, 2023

Session Replay is a powerful tool that can modernize your Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM) strategy. You can use it to capture and visually replay the complete digital experience of every user.

You can record your customers' interactions with your application and replay each click or tap in a movie-like experience. Session Replay also makes it easy for your QA teams to reproduce production issues, which your developers can use to bridge the gap between code and user experience.

Session Replay helps identify errors that should be fixed immediately and other problems such as malformed pages and infinite spinners. You can also use Session Replay to identify and analyze areas of struggle in your application and improve its overall usability.

Session Replay is currently available for [web applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-replay/configure-session-replay-web "Configure monitoring consumption and data privacy settings for Session Replay."), [Android](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-replay/session-replay-android "Set up Session Replay for your Android apps to learn which actions your users perform."), and [iOS](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-replay/session-replay-ios "Prerequisites and the procedure for enabling Session Replay for your iOS apps.").

[![Hub](https://dt-cdn.net/images/hub-512-82db3c583e.png "Hub")

### Explore in Dynatrace Hub

Fix bugs and simplify complex issues with visual recordings of user sessions.](https://www.dynatrace.com/hub/detail/session-replay/?internal_source=doc&internal_medium=link&internal_campaign=cross)

Session Replay is not supported on Cordova, React Native, Flutter, Xamarin, and .NET MAUI.

## Uses for Session Replay

### Error drill-down

With Session Replay, you can drill down further into the details of detected errors:

* Detect errors and other issues.
* Understand the exact user actions that led to an error.
* Understand the severity of the problem and its effect on user experience.
* Observe the customer impact by replaying and viewing a session when the problem isn't obvious.

Developers can use Session Replay to view, analyze, reproduce, and fix errors.

For error drill-down, you don't need to have all sessions recorded. You can use [cost and traffic control for web applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-replay/configure-session-replay-web#cost-traffic-control "Configure monitoring consumption and data privacy settings for Session Replay.") to record only a subset of sessions. If the error to be analyzed isn't too sporadic, it can be detected even if only 20% of sessions are recorded.

The default [data retention](/docs/manage/data-privacy-and-security/data-privacy/data-retention-periods "Check retention times for various data types.") timeframe is applied to these sessions.

The ability to play back recorded user sessions with or without playback [masking](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-replay/configure-session-replay-web#sr-masking "Configure monitoring consumption and data privacy settings for Session Replay.") settings is permission controlled. Permissions are available at the environment level as well as the management-zone level. Read more in [Manage user groups and permissions](/docs/manage/identity-access-management/permission-management/role-based-permissions#permissions "Role-based permissions").

### Complaint resolution

Because Session Replay is the best way to demonstrate what the user actually did, it provides the means to resolve customer complaints. Use Session Replay to:

* See the exact journey of the customer in your application.
* Identify the exact problem faced by the user.
* Provide correct instructions.

For customer complaint resolution, it's ideal that all sessions be recorded. However, to save storage space, we recommend that a lower retention time be set.

### Usability analysis

You can use Session Replay to detect and analyze the following issues:

* The UX design isn't intuitive enough.
* The process flow is too complicated, and users leave your application midway.
* The application is slow, and the user repeatedly clicks or taps to move to the next page or jump to the next screen.
* The application doesn't work as expected on all browsers or devices.
* The application prompts the user to change the orientation of their device, but the user doesn't understand the prompt.

The default [data retention](/docs/manage/data-privacy-and-security/data-privacy/data-retention-periods "Check retention times for various data types.") time is applied to these sessions.

## Technical restrictions for web applications

For web applications, Session Replay is compatible with page-based applications, single-page applications, and applications that use iFrames. However, [certain restrictions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-replay/session-replay-restrictions-web "Learn which restrictions apply to Session Replay.") apply.

# User details

# User details

* Explanation
* 3-min read
* Updated on Jul 20, 2023

For web applications, Dynatrace can show you all the sessions of an individual user, even when those sessions are anonymous or when a [user tag](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#user-tagging "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace.") has been changed or gone missing. User identification is achieved by storing a persistent cookie within each user's browser. This cookie contains a unique identifier for the user, which is marked as the **Internal user ID** in the Dynatrace web UI. Cookies enable Dynatrace to assign even anonymous user sessions to known users. As long as a user has logged into your application at least once, you can search for and identify that user, even when the user accesses the application in anonymous, unauthenticated sessions. This is particularly useful for analyzing periods of time when a user might not have been able to log into your application because of issues with your authentication service. Note that if a user disables persistent cookies or clears their cookies, the unique identifier is regenerated.

For mobile applications, user identification is achieved by generating and storing a unique identifier when a user launches an application for the first time. This identifier, marked as the **Internal user ID** in the Dynatrace web UI, is regenerated when the user changes their [privacy settings](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile#opt-in-mode-mobile "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region."). It's only possible to view all sessions of a particular user when the [data collection level](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/configure-rum-privacy-mobile#data-collection-levels "Leverage privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your mobile apps comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.") is set to **User behavior**; when the data collection level is set to **Off** or **Performance**, the unique identifier is regenerated for every session, making it impossible to list several sessions of a particular user.

## Focus on the sessions of a single user

On the **User details** page (available by selecting a user from the **User sessions** page), you can find a list of all the sessions of a particular user, the devices this user has used to access your applications, which applications the user accessed, and an overview of the user's profile.

![User detail](https://dt-cdn.net/images/image001-2540-9a3b332524.png)

You can further refine your analysis of the sessions of an individual user by using filter attributes in the filter field, or by enabling **Extended users**.

Extended users

In Dynatrace, there are two ways to identify a user: through the device identifier or through the [user tag](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#user-tagging "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace."). The concept of **extended user** covers use cases where multiple users or user tags share one device. Dynatrace creates segments of the clusters where the same user tags or device identifiers meet in different combinations. You can turn on these segments comprising different combinations when looking at a user on the user detail page.

![Extended users](https://dt-cdn.net/images/2021-03-24-09-30-56-1351-151ffe14ea.png)

* When you turn on **Extended users**, all information on the user detail page extends to cover all different combinations of the initial user and the user's relations to other devices and/or user tags.
* When you turn off **Extended users**, information displayed on the user detail page consists exclusively of the data from the specific user tag and the devices used by that user tag. If there's no user tag, then the device identifier is used and only for that particular device. For details on how to configure user tagging, see [User tagging](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#user-tagging "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace.").

Select any session in the list to view the details of that session, including all user actions and events displayed on a timeline. Here you'll find session details, including **Operating system**, device **Manufacturer**, **User tag**, **IP address**, and more.

![Sess detail](https://dt-cdn.net/images/image003-2540-3f624dde4c.png)

### Analysis chart

* The X-axis of the **Analysis** chart shows when the actions occurred during the session, the duration of the action (how long the "dot" is), and the wait time between each action.
* The Y-axis indicates mobile actions, user identifier, and errors and annoyances (for example, `Crash` or `Rage tap`).

![Xaxis](https://dt-cdn.net/images/image005-2530-db89702f1d.png)

Hover over a specific action to get a quick summary of the action. Select a specific action to start replaying the action (if Session Replay has been recorded on the session) or to see more details as shown below.

![Summary](https://dt-cdn.net/images/image007-2530-9eaa21246f.png)

## Examples

Following are examples of session analysis for a single user.

Analyze the sessions of a specific user

### Understand user behavior

To understand how user behavior analysis relates to customer satisfaction, itâs helpful to look at the distribution of the [user experience score](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/scores-and-ratings/user-experience-score "User experience score is a metric used to categorize user sessions as Frustrating, Tolerable, or Satisfying.")).

![Score](https://dt-cdn.net/images/image009-1260-ce456bd0a5.png)

Identify user sessions that have a high number of actions

You can sort the sessions list by **Action count** to find the sessions with the highest number of actions (the same goes for the other columns).

![Action count](https://dt-cdn.net/images/image011-2492-1f5aa2b022.png)

Find sessions of a specific user that resulted in errors or annoyances

When analyzing the user sessions of an individual user, you might want to know which sessions had an error or annoyance or to look at the sessions that had the highest number of errors and annoyances combined (such as [rage clicks or rage taps](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#rage-event "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace.")).

Get an overview of user activity during the day

When analyzing a user's behavior, it can be interesting to understand at what time of day the user is most active. For example, if a particular user is connected to both web and mobile applications, you can filter for either and see when they are connected throughout the day for the specific application type.

Dynatrace captures detailed [user session data](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/new-user-sessions "Learn about user session segmentation and filtering attributes.") each time a user interacts with your monitored application. This data includes all user actions and high level performance data. Using either the Dynatrace API or Dynatrace User Sessions Query Language (USQL), you can easily run powerful queries, segmentations, and aggregations on this captured data. To assist you, this topic provides detail about keywords and functions, syntax, working with Real User Monitoring tables, automated queries, and more.

User Sessions Query Language isn't [SQLï»¿](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), and Dynatrace doesn't store user session data in a relational database. User Sessions Query Language is a Dynatrace-specific query language, though it does rely on some SQL concepts and the syntax is similar, which makes it easy to get started.

Select your preferred approach:

User session queries via the Dynatrace web UI

1. Go to ![Query user sessions](https://dt-cdn.net/images/query-user-sessions-512-77c5a8da9f.png "Query user sessions") **Query User Sessions**.
2. Enter the query, and select **Run query**.

### Timeframe selector with USQL

With the timeframe selector, user session data can be filtered based on a selected analysis timeframe. Select a new timeframe.

![Timeframe selector: menu bar](https://dt-cdn.net/images/timeframe-selector-menu-bar-264-8193110c8c.png)

#### Timeframe selector controls

The global timeframe selector serves as a time filter that, in most cases, enables you to select a specific analysis timeframe that persists across all product pages and views as you navigate through your analysis.

![Timeframe selector: presets](https://dt-cdn.net/images/timeframe-selector-basic-355-f0a835da1e.png)

* The **Presets** tab lists all standard timeframes available. Select one to change your timeframe to that preset.
* The **Custom** tab displays a calendar. Click a start day, click an end day, and then click **Apply** to select that range of days as your timeframe.

  + Selected calendar intervals are set to end on start of the next day (with the time set to `00:00`). For example, if you select September 3 to September 4 on the calendar, the timeframe starts on September 3 at time `00:00` and ends on September **5** at time `00:00`, so you never miss the last minute of the time range. You can edit these displayed times.
* The **Recent** tab displays recently used timeframes. Select one to revert to that timeframe.
* The **<** and **>** controls shift the timerange forward or backward in time. The increment is the length of the original timerange. For example, if the current timerange is `Last 2 hours` (the two-hour range ending now), click **<** to shift the timerange two hours back, to `-4h to -2h` (the two-hour range ending two hours ago).
* Hover over the timeframe to see the start time, duration, and end time.

  ![Timeframe selector: hover](https://dt-cdn.net/images/timeframe-selector-hover-168-cfb13dc777.png)

#### Timeframe selector expressions

If you select the current timeframe in the menu bar, an editable timeframe expression is displayed.

* Reading from left to right, a timeframe expression has a start time, a `to` operator, and an end time.
* If there is no explicit end time, the `to` and `now` are implied. For example, `-2h` is the same `-2h to now`.
* Supported units: `s`, `m`, `h`, `d`, `w`, `M`, `q`, `y` (you can also use whole words such as `minutes` and `quarter`)

**Example timeframe expressions**

**Meaning**

`today`

From the beginning of today to the beginning of tomorrow.

`yesterday`

From the beginning of yesterday to the beginning of today. Like `-1d/d to today`.

`yesterday to now`

From the beginning of yesterday to the current time today.

`previous week`

The previous seven whole days. If today is Monday, you get the previous Monday through the previous Sunday (yesterday).

`this year`

The current calendar year, from January 1 of this year at `00:00` through January 1 of next year at `00:00`.

`last 6 weeks`

The last 42 days (6 weeks \* 7 days) ending now. Equivalent to `-6w to now`.

`-2h`

From 2 hours (120 minutes) ago to the current time (`now` is implied). Equivalent to `Last 2 hours` and `-2h to now`.

`-4d to -1h30m`

From 4 days (96 hours) ago to 1.5 hours ago.

`-1w`

The last 7 days (168 hours), from this time 7 days ago to the current time (`now`). Equivalent to `-7d` and `-168h`.

`-1w/w`

From the beginning of the previous calendar week to the current time (now).

* If you used `-1w/w` on a Friday afternoon at 3:00, you would get a range of 11 days 15 hours, starting with the beginning of the previous week's Monday, because `/w` rounds down to the beginning of the week.
* If you used `-1w` without `/w` on a Friday afternoon at 3:00, the start time would be exactly 7 days (168 hours) earlier: the previous Friday at 3:00 in the afternoon.

In general, `/` used in combination with a unit (such as `/d`, `/w`, `/M`, and `/y`) means to round down the date or time to the beginning of the specified time unit. For example, `-3d` means exactly 72 hours ago, whereas `-3d/d` means three days ago rounded down to the nearest day (starting at time `00:00`, the beginning of the day). Use `now/d` to mean the start of today.

`-1w/w + 8h`

Starting from the beginning of last week plus 8 hours (8:00 AM Monday).

* Note that you can use the `+` and `-` operators with units, timestamps, and `now`.

`-1d/d+9h00m to -1d/d+17h00m`

Business hours yesterday, from 09:00 - 17:00 (9 AM to 5 PM).

`2020-08-16 21:28 to 2020-08-19 10:02`

An absolute range consisting of absolute start and end dates and times in `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm` format.

* If you provide a date but omit the time (for example, just `2020-08-16`), the time is assumed to be the beginning of day (`00:00`)
* If you provide a time but omit the date (for example, just `21:28`), the date is assumed to be today

`1598545932346 to 1598837052346`

Unix epoch millisecond timestamps.

### Autocomplete with USQL

Auto-completion is available for query statements based on the currently entered text. Auto-complete is context-sensitive and based on the current cursor context. It intelligently anticipates what text you may want to type next.

Autocomplete information returned from the API contains a list of suggestions, with the most likely values sorted to the top of the list, along with the necessary adjustment to the query text and the resulting cursor position after the adjustment. This allows you to place the cursor at a more useful position once text has been added, such as inside brackets when you select a function.

The fields list only contains valid fields or functions for the selected table, and its context-sensitivity shows only numeric fields when the cursor is placed inside a function-call that only works on numerical data, such as `SUM()`, or `AVG()`.

Field-values are only suggested for enumeration based fields. No actual query to Elasticsearch is done for auto-completion.

Dynatrace Environment API

You can execute API calls using your preferred client. Find the related API documentation in [User sessions API](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/user-sessions "Learn what the Dynatrace User Sessions Query language API offers.").

To execute these calls, you need the **User sessions** (`DTAQLAccess`) permission assigned to your API token. To learn how to obtain and use your token, see [Dynatrace API - Tokens and authentication](/docs/dynatrace-api/basics/dynatrace-api-authentication "Find out how to get authenticated to use the Dynatrace API.").

### Timeframes in Environment API

User session data should always be accessed with a timeframe. It can be costly to access large timeframes because of the high number of potential single matches to queries.

The timeframe is usually not part of the query itself but is sent in separate parameters of the API call. You can find details in the API documentation.

You can, however, use the time fields like `starttime` and `endtime` to select a timeframe. You can also use these fields in functions, for example, to find out what time during the day most user sessions start, as in `HOUR(starttime)`.

## Keywords and functions

The following keywords have been defined to access user session data:

`AND`, `AS`, `ASC`, `BETWEEN`, `BY`, `DESC`, `DISTINCT`, `FALSE`, `FROM`, `GROUP`, `IN`, `IS`, `JSON`, `LIMIT`, `NOT`, `NULL`, `OR`, `ORDER`, `SELECT`, `STARTSWITH`, `TRUE`, `WHERE`, `LIKE`, `FILTER`

The following functions have been defined to access user session data:

`SUM`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `AVG`, `MEDIAN`, `COUNT`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`, `HOUR`, `MINUTE`, `DATETIME`, `TOP`, `PERCENTILE`, `KEYS`

Keywords, functions, and column names are case-insensitive. String-matches in `WHERE` conditions are case-sensitive.

## Syntax

A typical query is built from the following keywords:

`SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <condition> GROUP BY <grouping> ORDER BY <ordering>`

However, the only mandatory elements are `SELECT <columns>` and `FROM <table>`.

Example

```
SELECT browserType, userId, city, AVG(userActionCount) AS "Average user action count", AVG(duration) AS "Average duration", count(*) AS "Sessions", SUM(totalErrorCount) AS "Errors" FROM usersession WHERE ip between '52.179.11.1' and '52.179.11.255' GROUP BY browserType, userId, city
```

### Frequently used keywords

#### SELECT `<columns>`

Selects one or more columns from the specified data table or performs aggregation functions from the set of supported functions.

```
columns: [DISTINCT] <column>, <column>, ... | function(<parameter>) |



<column> AS <alias> | JSON
```

Example

```
SELECT country, city, browserfamily FROM usersession



SELECT DISTINCT country, city, useractioncount FROM usersession



SELECT country, city, avg(duration) AS average FROM usersession GROUP BY country, city
```

#### FUNNEL

Allows you to use a predefined funnel format for a query. Can be used to chart the flow of specific user actions. Can also be combined with custom session properties and other conditions.

It changes the syntax of any query to the following:

```
SELECT FUNNEL (<condition> AS <alias>, <condition>, ...) FROM <table> WHERE <condition>
```

* For `FUNNEL` queries, don't use `SELECT *` functions or keywords like `JSON`.
* Currently, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, or `LIMIT` statements are not allowed in the funnels.
* `FUNNEL` does not support ordering. There's no guarantee that `useraction1` happened before `useraction2` for the `SELECT FUNNEL (useraction.name = "useraction1", useraction.name = "useraction2") FROM usersession` query. This query is only the equivalent of two `SELECT` statements, as explained in the examples below.

Example 1

Instead of running the following three queries:

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM usersession where useraction.name = "AppStart"



SELECT COUNT(*) FROM usersession where useraction.name = "AppStart" AND useraction.name = "searchJourney"



SELECT COUNT(*) FROM usersession where useraction.name = "AppStart" AND useraction.name = "searchJourney"  AND useraction.name = "bookJourney"
```

The following single query returns the same result:

```
SELECT FUNNEL (useraction.name = "AppStart", useraction.name = "searchJourney", useraction.name = "bookJourney")



FROM usersession
```

Example 2

To list the number of users that successfully booked the journey:

```
SELECT FUNNEL (useraction.name="login", useraction.name = "searchJourney", useraction.name = "bookJourney")



FROM usersession
```

#### FROM `<table>`

You can only specify one table. Tables for user session data are as follows.

* `usersession` contains information on [user sessions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-session "Learn how a user session is defined, when a user session starts or ends, how user session duration is calculated, and more.").
* `useraction` stores data on [user actions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-actions "Learn what user actions are and how they help you understand what users do with your application.").
* `userevent` provides information on [user events](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#user-events "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace."), such as page changes or rage events.
* `usererror` contains more data on [error events](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#error-events "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace."), which are errors and crashes.

Example

```
SELECT country, city, browserfamily FROM usersession



SELECT name, starttime, endtime, duration FROM useraction ORDER BY duration DESC
```

#### WHERE `<condition>`

You can combine multiple conditions using Boolean logic and parentheses within the `WHERE` clause, such as `WHERE (city = 'Barcelona' AND country = 'Spain')` to include only cities named Barcelona that are in Spain.

```
condition: (condition AND condition) | (condition OR condition) | field IN(...) |



field IS <value> | field IS NULL | field = <value> | field > <value> | field < <value> |



field <> <value> | field IS NOT <value> | field BETWEEN <value> AND <value> | ...
```

However, only the right-hand side of conditions can contain a value, so you can't compare between two fields.

Examples

```
SELECT country, city, browserfamily FROM usersession WHERE country = 'Albania' AND screenWidth > 1000



SELECT TOP(country, 20), TOP(city, 20), TOP(duration, 10), AVG(duration) AS average



FROM usersession



WHERE duration BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000



GROUP BY TOP(country, 20), TOP(city, 20), TOP(duration, 10)
```

#### GROUP BY `<grouping>`

Whenever fields are aggregated, you must specify corresponding `GROUP BY` keywords to indicate how the aggregation is to be performed.

```
grouping: <column>, ...
```

Example

```
SELECT city, count(*) FROM usersession GROUP BY city



SELECT MONTH(starttime) as month, count (*) FROM usersession



GROUP BY month
```

#### LIMIT `<limit>`

Allows you to limit the number of returned results. For example, you can select only the top 10 results when it is combined with ordering.

The framework always applies an upper limit to prevent system overload. If `LIMIT` is not used, 50 results are returned by default.

Example

```
SELECT city, starttime FROM usersession ORDER BY starttime DESC LIMIT 10
```

`LIMIT` can also be used to increase the number of results in cases where the `LIMIT` clause is missing, because then a default limit is applied.

#### ORDER BY `<ordering>`

Allows you to order the results by columns, in either ascending or descending order. The order is ascending if not specified.

The ordering is done by frequency. For example, the top 5 returned cities are the most frequently occurring ones. By specifying a field in the `ORDER BY` clause, you can add a sort-by value for strings, dates, and numbers.

Ordering by `enums` or by `function values` such as `AVG` and `SUM` orders the returned results, but you may not get the top items. For example, if you request the top 5 results by `AVG(duration)`, requesting only 10 may add results even at the top.

```
ordering: <column> ASC | <column> DESC | <column>, ...
```

Example 1

```
SELECT useraction.name, starttime FROM usersession ORDER BY starttime DESC
```

Example 2

You can achieve ordering of counts by adding the `DISTINCT` keyword.

```
SELECT DISTINCT city, COUNT(*) FROM usersession ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
```

Example 3

You can achieve ordering of functions in the select list by stating the column name only or the alias defined in the `SELECT`.

```
SELECT avg(duration) AS average, count(*) as number, day(startTime) as startDay



FROM usersession where duration < 2000



GROUP BY startTime



ORDER BY average
```

or

```
SELECT avg(duration) AS average, count(*) as number, day(startTime) as startDay



FROM usersession where duration < 2000



GROUP BY startTime



ORDER BY number DESC, average ASC
```

#### LIKE

Allows you to compare data with an expression by using wildcard characters to match the specified pattern. You can use the following characters:

* `%` or `*`: Matches any string of 0 or more characters
* `?`: Matches any single character

String values are case-sensitive. For example, `SELECT city FROM usersession WHERE userId LIKE "*dynatrace*"` matches `me@dynatrace.com` but not `me@dynaTrace.com`. To avoid this, use the `?` wildcard character as in this example: `SELECT city FROM usersession WHERE userId LIKE "*dyna?race*"`

Escape wildcard characters

To escape a wildcard character, add a backslash `\` before it. For example, `\%`, `\*`, and `\?` are treated as standard string literals `%`, `*`, and `?`.

To escape a backslash `\` itself, add another backslash `\` before it. The resulting `\\` entry is treated as a single backslash `\`.

If you add two backslashes `\\` before a wildcard character (resulting in entries like `\\%`, `\\*`, or `\\?`), such an entry is treated as one escaped backslash `\` and one wildcard character. For example, the `\\*` entry matches `\abc`, `\123ABC`, or `\`.

Summary of how to escape wildcard characters:

| Entry | Treated as | Matches |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `\%` | `%` | `%` |
| `\*` | `*` | `*` |
| `\?` | `?` | `?` |
| `\\` | `\` | `\` |
| `\\%` | `\` and any string of zero or more characters | `\abc`, `\123ABC`, `\`, etc. |
| `\\*` | `\` and any string of zero or more characters | `\abc`, `\123ABC`, `\`, etc. |
| `\\?` | `\` and any single character | `\a`, `\1`, `\A`, etc. |

Examples of how to escape wildcard characters:

```
SELECT userId FROM usersession WHERE userId LIKE "AU\%40KWM"
```

The query matches `userId` that equals `AU%40KWM`.

```
SELECT userId FROM usersession WHERE userId like "AU\*40KWM"
```

The query matches `userId` that equals `AU*40KWM`.

```
SELECT userId FROM usersession WHERE userId LIKE "AU\?40KWM"
```

The query searches for a `userId` that equals `AU?40KWM`.

```
SELECT userId FROM usersession WHERE userId LIKE "AU\\%40KWM"
```

The query has one escaped backslash `\` and one wildcard character `%`, so the query matches a `userId` such as `AU\40KWM`, `AU\abcd40KWM`, `AU\ab12340KWM`, or `AU\777_12340KWM`.

Queries with 11+ LIKE conditions with non-trailing wildcards are rejected

USQL queries that have 11 or more `LIKE` conditions with `*` or `%` at the beginning or inside the search pattern (but not at the end) are rejected from execution.

Usually, we simply count the number of `LIKE` conditions used in the query. For example, there are five `LIKE` conditions in the query belowâwe count each occurrence of `LIKE` in the `WHERE` clause and the `CONDITION` function.

```
SELECT CONDITION(COUNT(userSessionId), WHERE useraction.name LIKE '*search.html'),



CONDITION(COUNT(userSessionId), WHERE useraction.name LIKE '*booking-payment1.html')



FROM usersession



WHERE city LIKE "%York"



OR city LIKE "S*Francisco"



AND city LIKE "L*inz"
```

However, when the [`FUNNEL` function](#funnel) is used, the calculation becomes more complicated. For this function, we internally transform one query into several queries. After that transformation, we count the number of `LIKE` conditions in those internally transformed queries.

For example, the following query:

```
SELECT FUNNEL (useraction.name LIKE "*start", useraction.name LIKE "Jou%rney", useraction.name LIKE "bookJourn*ey") FROM usersession
```

is changed to the following three queries:

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM usersession where useraction.name LIKE "*start"



SELECT COUNT(*) FROM usersession where useraction.name LIKE "*start" AND useraction.name LIKE "Jou%rney"



SELECT COUNT(*) FROM usersession where useraction.name LIKE "*start" AND useraction.name LIKE "Jou%rney" AND useraction.name LIKE "bookJourn*ey"
```

This means there are actually six `LIKE` conditions in the `FUNNEL` query above.

#### FILTER

Allows you to filter for functions that have numeric values, thereby displaying only specific results from aggregations.

Example

```
SELECT useraction.application,



AVG(usersession.doubleProperties.bookings)



FILTER > 1500



FROM usersession



WHERE usersession.doubleProperties.bookings IS NOT NULL



GROUP BY useraction.application
```

The `WHERE` and `FILTER` functions aren't interchangeable. While you can use the `WHERE` clause only on absolute values, the `FILTER` function works on aggregated values as well.

### Frequently used functions

#### MIN(field)

Queries the minimum value of a numeric or date field.

Example

```
SELECT MIN(duration), MAX(duration), AVG(duration), MEDIAN(duration)



FROM usersession
```

#### MAX(field)

Queries the maximum value of a numeric or date field.

Example

```
SELECT MIN(duration), MAX(duration), AVG(duration), MEDIAN(duration)



FROM usersession
```

#### AVG(field)

Queries the average value of a numeric or date field. May be `NaN` if the field is always `null`.

Example

```
SELECT MIN(duration), MAX(duration), AVG(duration), MEDIAN(duration)



FROM usersession
```

#### MEDIAN(field)

Queries the median value of a numeric or date field.

Example

```
SELECT MIN(duration), MAX(duration), AVG(duration), MEDIAN(duration)



FROM usersession
```

#### SUM(field)

Computes the sum of a numerical field.

Example

```
SELECT TOP(name, 20), SUM(duration) FROM useraction



GROUP BY name
```

#### COUNT(field), COUNT(\*), COUNT(DISTINCT field)

Counts the number of rows that match.

* `COUNT(*)`: Counts the number of matching items.
* `COUNT(<field>)`: Counts the number of matching items where `<field>` is not null.
* `COUNT(DISTINCT <field>)`: Counts the number of different values for `<field>` within the selected items.

Example

```
SELECT country, COUNT(*), COUNT(city), COUNT(DISTINCT city)



FROM usersession



GROUP BY country
```

Results returned by the `COUNT(DISTINCT <field>)` function are approximate to prevent high memory usage. If `COUNT(DISTINCT <field>)` is used on a high-cardinality field, results might be even more rough. High-cardinality fields are those fields that have only few duplicates.

Results based on extrapolated data can be even more generalized; see [Limitations](#limitations) for more information.

High-cardinality fields

| Table | Fields |
| --- | --- |
| `usersession` | `ip` , `userSessionId` , `internalUserId` , `userId` |

Dynatrace rejects and doesn't execute the queries with `COUNT(DISTINCT <field>)` that might consume a lot of memory. This happens for all extremely high-cardinality fields, for example, for the `dateTime` fields like `usersession.startTime`, `usersession.endTime`, or `useraction.networkTime`.

Extremely high-cardinality fields

| Table | Fields |
| --- | --- |
| `usersession` | `startTime` , `endTime` , `replayEnd` , `clientTimeOffset`, `duration` , `replayStart` |
| `useraction` | `domContentLoadedTime` , `startTime` , `firstPartyBusyTime` , `documentInteractiveTime` , `navigationStart` , `totalBlockingTime` Deprecated, `largestContentfulPaint` , `visuallyCompleteTime` , `cdnBusyTime` , `endTime` , `domCompleteTime` , `networkTime` , `loadEventStart` , `serverTime` , `firstInputDelay` , `responseStart` , `thirdPartyBusyTime` , `duration` , `loadEventEnd` , `responseEnd` , `frontendTime` , `requestStart` |
| `userevent` | `startTime` |
| `usererror` | `startTime` |

Example

```
SELECT country, COUNT(*), COUNT(city), COUNT(DISTINCT city)



FROM usersession



GROUP BY country
```

#### TOP(field, n)

Returns the top `<n>` results from a field. The default is `1` (the top value) if `n` is not specified.

Example

```
SELECT TOP(name, 20), SUM(duration)



FROM useraction



GROUP BY name
```

If `TOP(<field>, n)` is selected and the results are grouped, but `<field>` is not part of the grouping, the top-n elements return as a list within a single field.

```
SELECT TOP(country, 20), TOP(city, 3), COUNT(*)



FROM usersession



GROUP BY country
```

#### YEAR(datefield), MONTH(datefield), DAY(datefield), HOUR(datefield), MINUTE(datefield)

Returns the given element extracted from a date field.

* `YEAR`: The four-digit year.
* `MONTH`: The month number, between 1 and 12
* `DAY`: The day of the month, between 1 and 31.
* `HOUR`: The hour value, between 0 and 23.
* `MINUTE`: The minute value, between 0 and 59.

Example

```
SELECT starttime,



DATETIME(starttime), YEAR(starttime), MONTH(starttime), DAY(starttime), HOUR(starttime), MINUTE(starttime)



FROM usersession



ORDER BY starttime DESC
```

#### DATETIME(datefield [, format [, interval]])

Formats the selected date field with the given format string. The default format is `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm`.

The allowed letters within the format string are:

* `y`: year
* `M`: month
* `d`: day of month
* `H`: hour (0-23)
* `h`: hour (1-12)
* `m`: minute
* `s`: second
* `E`: day of week (Mon-Sun)

The `year`|`month`|`week` intervals are for a single `interval`. For `d` (days), `h` (hours), `m` (minutes), or `s` (seconds), you can use a number followed by the letter for the format string, such as `5m`. For example, `SELECT DISTINCT DATETIME(starttime, 'HH:mm', '5m'), COUNT(*) FROM usersession` counts sessions in five-minute time blocks.

Example

```
SELECT DATETIME(starttime, 'yyyy-MM') FROM usersession



SELECT DISTINCT DATETIME(starttime, 'HH:mm', '5m'), COUNT(*) FROM usersession
```

Similar to other date functions (`YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`, `HOUR`, and `MINUTE`), you can use `DATETIME` to format a result (even the result of other functions like `MAX`, `MIN`, `AVG`, or `CONDITION`), create histograms, or retrieve a list of timestamps where there are results, for example, the days of a week when an application was used.

Examples

```
SELECT application, DATETIME(MAX(starttime)) AS LastUsedTime FROM useraction GROUP BY application



SELECT DATETIME(starttime, "HH") AS hourOfDay, COUNT(*) FROM usersession GROUP BY hourOfDay



SELECT application, DATETIME(starttime, "E") AS daysOfWeek FROM useraction GROUP BY application



SELECT DATETIME(CONDITION(MAX(startTime), WHERE name = "index.jsp")) FROM useraction
```

#### CONDITION(function, condition)

Allows you to combine multiple functions with various conditions.

The allowed functions within the format string are as follows:

* `MIN()`
* `MAX()`
* `AVG()`
* `SUM()`
* `PERCENTILE()`
* `MEDIAN()`
* `COUNT()`

You can combine multiple conditions using Boolean logic and parentheses with the `CONDITION` function, such as `CONDITION(COUNT(*), WHERE city = 'Barcelona' AND country = 'Spain')` to include only cities named Barcelona that are in Spain.

```
CONDITION(function, condition)



condition:



(condition AND condition) | (condition OR condition) | field IN(...) |



field IS <value> | field IS NULL | field = <value> | field > <value> | field < <value> |



field <> <value> | field IS NOT <value> | field BETWEEN <value> AND <value> | ...
```

You can also use the `FILTER` clause filter for functions that have numeric values, thereby displaying only specific results from aggregations.

```
SELECT CONDITION(COUNT(usersessionId), WHERE userActionCount > 2 AND useraction.name = "search.jsp") FILTER > 1000, city FROM usersession GROUP BY city
```

Example

```
SELECT CONDITION(COUNT(usersessionId), WHERE userActionCount > 2 AND useraction.name = "search.jsp") FROM usersession



SELECT CONDITION(SUM(usersession.duration), WHERE name = "index.jsp") AS c1, CONDITION(SUM(usersession.duration), WHERE name = "search.jsp") AS c2, CONDITION(SUM(usersession.duration), WHERE name IS NOT "index.jsp" AND name IS NOT "search.jsp") AS c3 FROM useraction WHERE (duration > 1000 OR usersession.userActionCount > 4)



SELECT CONDITION(SUM(usersession.duration), WHERE name = "index.jsp") AS c1 FROM useraction WHERE (duration > 1000 OR usersession.userActionCount > 4) ORDER BY c1



SELECT DATETIME(CONDITION(MIN(startTime ), WHERE useraction.application = "RUM Default Application" ), "yyyy-MM-dd" ) FROM usersession
```

#### PERCENTILE

Represents a value below which there's a percentage of data points lower in value. Useful in detecting the speed of your application for customers who receive the slowest response time.

Example

```
SELECT name, usersession.country, usersession.browserFamily,



AVG(duration),



MEDIAN(duration),



PERCENTILE(duration, 99)



FROM useraction



WHERE useraction.name = "easytravel/rest/login"



GROUP BY usersession.country, usersession.browserFamily, name



ORDER BY usersession.continent
```

#### KEYS(customProperty)

Returns keys of [user action or user session properties](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/action-and-session-properties "User action and session properties, which are metadata key-value pairs, provide added visibility and deeper analysis of your end users' experience. Using these properties for your web applications, you can filter user sessions, add calculated metrics, create charts, and more.") according to the property data type defined in the argument.

Check the table below to understand whether keys of user action properties or keys of user session properties are returned.

| KEYS(customProperty) | Table | Action properties | Session properties |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `KEYS(<dataType>Properties)` | `useraction` | Applicable |  |
| `KEYS(<dataType>Properties)` | `usersession` |  | Applicable |
| `KEYS(useraction.<dataType>Properties)` | `useraction` | Applicable |  |
| `KEYS(useraction.<dataType>Properties)` | `usersession` | Applicable |  |
| `KEYS(usersession.<dataType>Properties)` | `useraction` |  | Applicable |
| `KEYS(usersession.<dataType>Properties)` | `usersession` |  | Applicable |

The `<dataType>` part of the function can take the following values:

* `string`
* `long`
* `double`
* `date`

Example 1

```
SELECT KEYS(stringProperties) FROM useraction WHERE application = "easyTravel demo application"



SELECT KEYS(useraction.longProperties) FROM usersession WHERE applicationType="WEB_APPLICATION" ORDER BY keys(useraction.longProperties)



SELECT KEYS(usersession.stringProperties) FROM useraction WHERE usersession.city ="Berlin"
```

For fetching distinct keys of action or session properties, use `DISTINCT KEYS(customProperty)`.

Example 2

```
SELECT DISTINCT KEYS(stringProperties) FROM useraction WHERE useraction.application = "easyTravel demo application" ORDER BY keys(stringProperties)



SELECT DISTINCT KEYS(doubleProperties) FROM usersession
```

## Mathematical operations

The following operations are supported as part of queries:

* operations on numbers
* operations on numeric and dateTime fields
* operations on certain functions such as `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`, `HOUR`, `MINUTE`
* operations on numeric values and display them in different uses of measurement

### Syntax

`Number/NumericField/DateTimeField/Function OPERATOR Number/NumericField/DateTimeField/Function`

Function: `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`, `HOUR` or `MINUTE`
Operator: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, or `MOD`

Example

```
SELECT 7 + 80 * 100, duration + startTime, MONTH(startTime) - 1



FROM usersession
```

## Conditions

All conditions must start with an identifier, such as a field name, and must be compared against a value. Two fields can't be compared against each other.

Quoted text is always case-sensitive.

### Basic operators

The basic operators for comparison are `=`, `!=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `IS`, and `IS NOT`.

To check if the value of a field is present, compare the field against `NULL`.

Example

```
SELECT userId FROM usersession WHERE userActionCount > 3
```

### Ranges

Ranges are handled by keywords such as `BETWEEN` or `NOT BETWEEN`, `<lowerLimit>`, and `<upperLimit>`.

Example 1

```
SELECT DISTINCT ip FROM usersession



WHERE ip BETWEEN '192.168.0.0' AND '192.168.255.255'
```

Example 2

```
SELECT startTime FROM useraction



WHERE NOT startTime BETWEEN $NOW - DURATION("2h") AND $NOW
```

Example 3

```
SELECT ip, browserType, userId, city



FROM usersession



WHERE NOT ip BETWEEN '52.179.11.1' AND '52.179.11.255'
```

### Sets

The `IN` keyword can be used shorten `"WHERE" <field> = val1 OR <field> = val2 OR <field> = val3`.

Example

```
SELECT userId FROM usersession WHERE city IN ("NEW YORK", "San Francisco")
```

### String conditions

The `"STARTSWITH"` string condition checks whether a string or an enum field starts with the specified text.

Example

```
SELECT city FROM usersession WHERE userId STARTSWITH "dynatrace"
```

### Datetime values

When conditions are run on a datetime field, the following value formats are supported:

| Format | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| â | Unix timestamp as a number in milliseconds | `1514152800000` |
| `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ` | ISO datetime with the time zone | `2017-12-24T21:00:00+01:00` |
| `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss` | Date with optional time | `2017-12-24 21:00` |
| `yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss` | Date with optional time | `2017/12/24 21` |
| `MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss` | Date with optional time | `12/24/2017` |
| `dd.MM.yyyy HH:mm:ss` | Date with optional time | `24.12.2017 21:00:00` |

For the formats where time is optional, the following time formats are supported:

| Format | Example |
| --- | --- |
| `HH:mm:ss` | `08:20:59` |
| `H:mm:ss` | `8:20:59` |
| `HH:mm` | `08:20` |
| `H:mm` | `8:20` |
| `HH` | `08` |
| `H` | `8` |

If the time is missing, the default `00:00:00` is assumed.

Sometimes, queries with datetime values might yield incorrect results due to the Daylight Saving Time conversion. If the date in the query is before the Daylight Saving Time end date (for example, before November 7, 2021 02:00), try using the ISO datetime with a time offset, for example, `2021-10-05T17:30:00+03:00`.

Example

```
SELECT starttime FROM usersession WHERE starttime > "8.8.2018 8:00"
```

### Condition optimization

#### IN

When your query contains multiple "equals" conditions for the same field via `OR`, use the `IN` function instead, as it's more performant. For example, you can rewrite the following query using the `IN` function.

**Before**

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM userevent



WHERE pageReferrer = "/some/page/referrer/1"



OR pageReferrer = "/some/page/referrer/2"



OR pageReferrer = "/some/page/referrer/3"



OR pageReferrer = "/some/page/referrer/4"



OR pageReferrer = "/some/page/referrer/5"
```

**After**

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM userevent



WHERE pageReferrer IN ("/some/page/referrer/1",



"/some/page/referrer/2",



"/some/page/referrer/3",



"/some/page/referrer/4",



"/some/page/referrer/5")
```

#### NOT IN

To optimize the speed of your queries, use arrays for queries: instead of using several `NOT`, `<>`, or `!=` operators, use the `NOT IN` operator.

**Before**

```
SELECT useraction.name, usersession.userId



FROM useraction



WHERE name = "loading of page /"



AND usersession.userId IS NOT NULL



AND usersession.userId <> "Speed Travel Agency"



AND usersession.userId <> "some user"



AND usersession.userId <> "easyTravel - One step to happiness"



AND usersession.userId <> "easyTravel - Booking - Finish"
```

**After**

```
SELECT useraction.name, usersession.userId



FROM useraction



WHERE name = "loading of page /"



AND usersession.userId IS NOT NULL



AND NOT usersession.userId IN ("Speed Travel Agency",



"some user",



"easyTravel - One step to happiness",



"easyTravel - Booking - Finish")
```

## Advanced syntax constructs

### Query IP ranges

The IP field can be queried for ranges of addresses. Both `BETWEEN ip > <lower ipaddress range> AND ip < <upper ipaddress range>` or `BETWEEN <lower ipaddress range> AND <lower ipaddress range>` work.

Example

```
SELECT * FROM usersession WHERE ip > '211.44.94.0' AND ip < '212.113.5.0'



SELECT * FROM usersession WHERE ip BETWEEN '211.44.94.0' AND '212.113.5.0'
```

### Query timeframe selector

You can use the following keywords to select the start time and end time as defined in the timeframe selector.

* `TIME_FRAME_START`
* `TIME_FRAME_END`

Example

```
SELECT * FROM usersession WHERE startTime >= $TIME_FRAME_START AND endTime < $TIME_FRAME_END
```

Timeframe selectors can be used to limit the timeframe on queries that are run on secondary tables (`useraction`). By default, the timeframe filter is applied on the `usersession` table, even if the query is run on any secondary table. To apply the filter on a secondary table as well, you can use the timeframe selector to add a condition on the `startTime` field of the secondary table. See the following example to fetch the `name` and `duration` of user actions that occurred only in the query timeframe:

Example

```
SELECT name, duration FROM useraction



WHERE startTime BETWEEN $TIME_FRAME_START and $TIME_FRAME_END
```

### Query relative timeframe

You can select a timeframe relative to the time when the query was run. The current time is expressed with the `$NOW` variable.

`$NOW [+/-] DURATION("[number]TIME_UNIT")`

The following time units are supported to express the duration:

* `y`: year
* `q`: quarter
* `M`: month
* `d`: day
* `w`: week
* `h`: hour
* `m`: minute
* `s`: second

Example

```
SELECT * FROM usersession WHERE startTime >= $NOW - DURATION("1q") AND endTime <= $NOW



SELECT * FROM useraction WHERE startTime BETWEEN $NOW - DURATION("2h") AND $NOW



SELECT * FROM useraction WHERE usersession.startTime >= $TIME_FRAME_START - DURATION("2h") AND $NOW - DURATION("1h")
```

The timeframe selected in the Dynatrace web UI or Dynatrace API still applies to the results, even if timestamp-based filtering is used as part of your query.

### Secondary tables for `usersession`, `useraction`, `userevent`, and `usererror`

When using `SELECT` with `usersession`, `useraction`, `userevent`, or `usererror`, columns from the other table can be accessed and included in the results by prefixing column names with the table name.

Example 1

Selecting a logical view of the `usersession` or the `useraction` table. Multiple values concatenate in the resulting column when adding information from `useraction` into a query on `usersession`.

```
SELECT city, useraction.name FROM usersession



SELECT usersession.city, name FROM useraction
```

You can use other secondary tables `userevent` and `usererror` in the same way.

```
SELECT usersession.country, name, page FROM userevent



SELECT usersession.country, name, type FROM usererror



SELECT country, userevent.name, usererror.name FROM usersession
```

When you query from the `usersession` primary table, you can combine fields from other secondary tables (`useraction`, `userevent`, and `usererror`). You can use fields from the secondary tables in the `WHERE` condition too.

Example 2

```
SELECT city, useraction.name, userevent.page, usererror.type FROM usersession



SELECT city, usererror.name, userevent.page, useraction.duration FROM usersession WHERE usererror.name IS NOT NULL
```

Example 3

Listing all user sessions that contain a user event or a user action from the same application.

```
SELECT * FROM usersession



WHERE userevent.application = "a" OR useraction.application="a"
```

When you query from any of the secondary tables (`useraction`, `userevent`, or `usererror`), you can use fields only from the `usersession` primary table; you can't use fields from other secondary tables. For example, the query below fails, as the selected table is `userevent`, which means that only fields from `userevent` or `usersession` can be selected.

```
SELECT usersession.city, useraction.name, userevent.page, usererror.type FROM userevent
```

The same limitation applies to other secondary tablesâ`useraction` and `usererror`.

Example 4

The following queries won't fail, as only fields from the selected secondary table and from the primary table are used.

```
SELECT usersession.userId, name, duration FROM useraction



SELECT usersession.userId, name, type FROM usererror
```

There is no way to connect secondary tables to each other and derive any relations between the `useraction`, `userevent` or, `usererror`table, or in which order they happened. Therefore, it is not possible to say which `useraction` caused which `usererror`. The only connection we can make is to the `usersession` they belong to.

Applied conditions differ in meaning depending on the table. For example, consider that you want to list all user sessions that contain user actions with names `a` and `b`:

```
SELECT * FROM usersession



WHERE useraction.name = "a" AND useraction.name = "b"
```

This means, the session must contain a user action with name `"a"` and a user action with the name `"b"`. Running the same query on the `useraction` table returns an empty result as the same user action can't have two different values for the name.

If you want to select user session data for a specific user action that matches several criteria, run the following query on the `useraction` table.

```
SELECT usersession.*, * FROM useraction



WHERE useraction.name = "a" AND useraction.duration > 1000
```

In this case, each user action in the result satisfies both conditions.

Let's take a look at another query.

```
SELECT COUNT(usersession.userSessionId)



FROM usersession



WHERE userevent.name = 'Page change'



AND userevent.pageGroup = '/Booking'



AND userevent.type = 'UserTag'
```

Because the query is run on the `usersession` table, the conditions are applied on the total set of user events that belong to a single session. This means that any user session with user events that satisfy the conditions is reflected in the count. For example, if a user session contains three user events that each satisfy one of the given conditions, the user session is reflected in the count.

If you run the same query on the `userevent` table, the conditions are applied on each individual user event. This means that only user sessions that have at least one user event that satisfies **all** conditions are reflected in the count.

```
SELECT COUNT(usersession.userSessionId)



FROM userevent



WHERE userevent.name = 'Page change'



AND userevent.pageGroup = '/Booking'



AND userevent.type = 'UserTag'
```

### Filtering using fields of a secondary table

Be careful when filtering using the fields of one of the secondary tables. Consider the examples below.

**Example 1**

```
SELECT useraction.name FROM usersession WHERE useraction.name="abc"
```

This query returns a list of all user sessions that contain at least one user action named `abc`. The result contains a list of all user actions for each session because the query is run on the `usersession` level.

**Example 2**

```
SELECT name FROM useraction WHERE name="abc"
```

This query retrieves a list of only those user actions that are named `abc`.

### SELECT \* FROM table

Example

```
SELECT * FROM usersession



SELECT useraction.* FROM usersession



SELECT city, useraction.* FROM usersession



SELECT *, useraction.* FROM usersession
```

An asterisk `*` by itself selects columns from the main table, not the secondary table. For example, fields from `useraction` are not included in `SELECT * FROM usersession`, unless you include `useraction.*`.

### JSON export

The `JSON` keyword adds an additional column that contains the data about the requested entry (a user session, user action, user event, or user error) in JSON format.

If you select the `usersession` primary table, the full JSON strings for the matching user sessions are returned, regardless of the selected columns.

Example 1

The query below returns the matching user sessions as JSON in an additional column, including the data from all secondary tables.

```
SELECT usersessionId, browserFamily, useraction.name, useraction.duration, JSON



FROM usersession LIMIT 5
```

If you select a [secondary table](#usql-secondarytables) (`useraction`, `userevent`, or `usererror`), the full JSON strings for the matching sub-entry (a user action, user event, or user error) are returned.

Example 2

The query below returns the matching user actions as JSON in an additional column, without the data from the `usersession` table or other secondary tables.

```
SELECT name, duration, JSON



FROM useraction LIMIT 5
```

See also [Export user sessions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/export-session-data "Set up Dynatrace to export user session data to a provided webhook endpoint.").

### Escaping strings

String literals can be put within single or double quotes. However, if you want to use the same quotation mark inside the string, simply double it.

Example

```
SELECT * FROM usersession WHERE userId = "some 'custom' name for ""my user"""



SELECT * FROM usersession WHERE userId = 'some ''custom'' name for "my user"'
```

### Funnel charting

Funnel charting allows you to track steps through your digital service and investigate the areas of struggle faced by your users. In conjunction with Session Replay, this functionality allows you to see at which point your user is struggling in your application.

Example

```
SELECT FUNNEL(



useraction.name = "AppStart (easyTravel)" AS "Open easytravel",



useraction.name = "searchJourney" AS "Search journey",



useraction.name = "bookJourney" AS "Book journey",



useraction.matchingConversionGoals = "Payment" OR useraction.matchingConversionGoals = "booking-finished" AS "Booked")



FROM usersession
```

You can also filter for a specific segment. An example of this is using Session properties to extract the list of high priority customers.

Example

```
SELECT FUNNEL(



useraction.name = "AppStart (easyTravel)" AS "Open easytravel",



useraction.name = "searchJourney" AS "Search journey",



useraction.name = "bookJourney" AS "Book journey",



useraction.matchingConversionGoals = "Payment" OR useraction.matchingConversionGoals = "booking-finished" AS "Booked")



FROM usersession



WHERE stringProperties.memberstatus="GOLD"
```

`FUNNEL` does not support ordering. There's no guarantee that `useraction1` happened before `useraction2` for the `SELECT FUNNEL (useraction.name = "useraction1", useraction.name = "useraction2") FROM usersession` query. This query is only the equivalent of two `SELECT` statements.

## Available user session data tables and fields

For user session data, the following tables are available.

* `usersession` contains information on [user sessions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-session "Learn how a user session is defined, when a user session starts or ends, how user session duration is calculated, and more.").
* `useraction` stores data on [user actions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-actions "Learn what user actions are and how they help you understand what users do with your application.").
* `userevent` provides information on [user events](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#user-events "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace."), such as page changes or rage events.
* `usererror` contains more data on [error events](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#error-events "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace."), which are errors and crashes.

[Secondary tables for `usersession`, `useraction`, `userevent`, and `usererror`](#usql-secondarytables) include a description of how data in one of those tables is available in the other.

The fields are described in [User sessions API - User session structure](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/user-sessions/user-session-structure "Learn the structure of a user session in the Dynatrace User Session Query language API.").

You can also check the **UserSession** object in the [API Explorer](/docs/dynatrace-api#api-explorer "Find out what you need to use the Dynatrace API.").

## Run USQL queries for custom reports

A REST interface allows you to get results for your custom queries. All you need is to create a unique [API token](/docs/dynatrace-api/basics/dynatrace-api-authentication "Find out how to get authenticated to use the Dynatrace API.") with the **User session query language** privilege. The ability to query user session data this way is useful in automated testing, data verification, and other automated functions. It includes the following endpoints:

`/table`: Returns the data as a flat table, even when grouping by various items and performing hierarchical aggregations against the user session data.

`/tree`: Returns the data as a full hierarchical tree based on the input.

The following query-parameters are available:

`query`: Needs to be encoded when put into a URL, for example, `%20` instead of spaces.
`startTimestamp/endTimestamp`: Allows you to define points in time, passed as the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch. If not specified, this defaults to the last two hours.

Examples

This code:

```
curl --location --insecure -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Api-Token _token_" \



-XGET "https://{your-environment-id}.live.dynatrace.com/api/v1/userSessionQueryLanguage/table?query=select%20city,count(*)%20from%20usersession%20group%20by%20city"
```

provides the following result:

```
{



"columnNames": ["city",    "count(*)"],



"values": [



["Dublin",    23],



["N. Virginia (Amazon)",    80],



["Portland",    56]



]



}
```

This code:

```
curl --location --insecure -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Api-Token _token_" \



-XGET "https://{your-environment-id}.live.dynatrace.com/api/v1/userSessionQueryLanguage/tree?query=select%20country,city,count(*)%20from%20usersession%20group%20by%20country,city"
```

provides the following result:

```
{



"branchNames": ["country",    "city"],



"leafNames": ["count(*)"],



"values": {



"United States": {



"Portland": [56],



"N. Virginia (Amazon)": [83]



},



"Ireland": {



"Dublin": [24]



}



}



}
```

## Convert queries into USQL custom metrics

You can convert some queries into USQL custom metrics for your [web](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/custom-metrics-from-user-sessions "Every time a user session is closed, Dynatrace can extract metrics and store them as time series. Learn how to set up and use USQL custom metrics for web applications."), [mobile](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/custom-metrics-from-user-sessions-mobile-apps "Every time a user session is closed, Dynatrace can extract metrics and store them as time series. Learn how to set up and use USQL custom metrics for mobile applications."), and [custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/additional-configuration/custom-metrics-from-user-sessions-custom-apps "Every time a user session is closed, Dynatrace can extract metrics and store them as time series. Learn how to set up and use USQL custom metrics for custom applications.").

USQL custom metrics are available as
user session custom metrics (USCMs) and user action custom metrics (UACMs). User action custom metrics are supported since Dynatrace version 1.260.

1. Go to ![Query user sessions](https://dt-cdn.net/images/query-user-sessions-512-77c5a8da9f.png "Query user sessions") **Query User Sessions**.
2. Enter the query, and then select **Run query**.  
   For a list of supported fields, see the detailed guides for your [web](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/custom-metrics-from-user-sessions#properties-and-supported-values "Every time a user session is closed, Dynatrace can extract metrics and store them as time series. Learn how to set up and use USQL custom metrics for web applications."), [mobile](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/custom-metrics-from-user-sessions-mobile-apps#properties-and-supported-values "Every time a user session is closed, Dynatrace can extract metrics and store them as time series. Learn how to set up and use USQL custom metrics for mobile applications."), and [custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/additional-configuration/custom-metrics-from-user-sessions-custom-apps#properties-and-supported-values "Every time a user session is closed, Dynatrace can extract metrics and store them as time series. Learn how to set up and use USQL custom metrics for custom applications.").
3. Select **Create custom metric**.
4. Enter the metric name, and then review the proposed settings.

## Limitations

* Dynatrace stores and retains Real User Monitoring (user actions and user sessions) for a limited period of time. See [Data retention periods](/docs/manage/data-privacy-and-security/data-privacy/data-retention-periods "Check retention times for various data types.") for details.
* The default result set is 50 but the number of results can be increased to a maximum of 5000 by using the `LIMIT` keyword.
* The number of potential maximum bucketed results is limited to a maximum of 100,000. The default is 10,000.  
  This affects how `TOP()` is applied when `DISTINCT` or `GROUP BY` is used. If no `TOP()` is specified, 10,000 possible results are spread evenly across the specified columns. These default values can be overwritten by specifying a `TOP()` for each column. The multiplied `TOP()-` values can't exceed 100,000 results.

  Further limitations

  + The `TOP()` function can be used to increase the number of different values per aggregation.
  + The maximum number of different results per aggregation is limited to 1000.
  + The following query uses at most 10,000 theoretical possible results:
    `select browserFamily, city, count * FROM usersession group by browserFamily, city`
  + The following query includes `TOP()` and can therefore use up to 100,000 (100 Ã 1000) theoretical possible results:
    `select TOP(browserFamily, 1000), TOP(city, 100), count * FROM usersession group by browserFamily, city`
* Joins aren't allowed.
* Only one table is allowed per `SELECT`.
* Searches for string-values with regular expressions aren't supported.
* Two different fields can't be compared. For example `WHERE field1 = field2` doesn't work.
* `WHERE` conditions only work on fields, so neither `WHERE true` nor `WHERE COUNT(*) > 3` is supported.
* Only closed user sessions can be queried. Live user sessions aren't taken into account.
* Ordering is partially supported.

  For example, ordering by mathematical operation is not supported.

  ```
  SELECT endTime - startTime AS duration FROM usersession ORDER BY duration
  ```
* For extensive timeframes and high-load environments, we might extrapolate the data from a sampled subset (extrapolation level). This takes place regardless of whether you use the Dynatrace API or the Dynatrace web UI. If you need 100% accurate data, reduce the timeframe or add additional conditions to further filter out the requested data.
* Functions aren't allowed in the `GROUP BY` clause. Therefore, if you want to group by month, specify an alias.
* `FUNNEL` can't be used with the `SELECT *` functions, keywords such as `JSON`, and the `GROUP BY`, `ORDER` and `LIMIT` statements.
* For mathematical operations, support for `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and other operations on functions is not available.
* A maximum of 10 conditions can be applied to `FUNNEL`.
* Certain fields, such as `duration`, always return integer values instead of decimal values when mathematical operations, such as a division, are performed on them. This is because these fields are stored and displayed as integer values. For example, `SELECT duration FROM usersession` returns a duration of `4800`, and `SELECT duration/1000 FROM usersession` returns a duration of `5`.

# New: User session analysis

# New: User session analysis

* How-to guide
* 21-min read
* Updated on Oct 12, 2023

Dynatrace version 1.224+

While analysis of individual user sessions can be useful in some situations, such analysis is often incomplete. The users of your application behave in unexpected ways, perform different tasks with different goals in mind, reside in various geographic regions, and use countless combinations of devices, operating systems, and browsers.

Dynatrace supports user session segmentation through a powerful filtering mechanism. Dynatrace user session analysis enables you to slice, dice, and combine your application's user sessions into meaningful segments based on shared characteristics of individual user sessionsâoperating system, browser type, location, or user tag. For example, you might segment your analysis based on the following browser types: desktop, mobile, or synthetic. In this way, you can drill deeply into aggregate results to discover meaningful insights into performance problems that may only be experienced by a small subset of your users.

## Analyze a user session

To analyze a user session

1. Go to ![Session Segmentation](https://dt-cdn.net/images/session-segmentation-512-5278e8fa16.png "Session Segmentation") **Session Segmentation**.
2. Click the text field at the top of the page (see **1** in the example below), and select one of the available filtering attributes.
   Once you select an attribute, the available values for that filter are displayed in a list.

   ### Available filtering attributes

   | Attribute category | Attribute | Description |
   | --- | --- | --- |

   In filters, the tilde operator (`~`) doesn't work as the `LIKE` keyword in [USQL](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/custom-queries-segmentation-and-aggregation-of-session-data "Learn how you can access and query user session data based on keywords, syntax, functions, and more.").
3. Select the attribute value you're interested in. Some attributes provide text fields that you can use for free-text search. You can also select multiple values of one attribute; this works as an `OR` operator for that attribute.
4. Repeat this process for as many attributes as you are interested in. Once you've defined your filter, click anywhere outside the text box.

   The result of the defined filters provides a list of the first 500 sessions, which are ordered by the start time of the newest session. To change the order, sort the table columns in ascending or descending order.
5. Select a session timestamp (see **3** in the example below) to go to the user session details page. Alternatively, to analyze the sessions of a single user, select a username (see **2** in the example below) to navigate to that [user's details page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/analyze-all-sessions-of-a-single-user "Learn about user behavior by analyzing the user profile (user experience score) and session activity.").

![User sessions page](https://dt-cdn.net/images/new-user-sessions-page-3342-dd45c41c38.png)

Use the [timeframe selector](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/dashboards-classic/dashboards/dashboard-timeframe "Learn about Dynatrace dashboard timeframe and management zone settings.") in the menu bar to adjust the analysis timeframe of your user session analysis.

![Timeframe selector: menu bar](https://dt-cdn.net/images/timeframe-selector-menu-bar-264-8193110c8c.png)

Timeframe selector controls

The global timeframe selector serves as a time filter that, in most cases, enables you to select a specific analysis timeframe that persists across all product pages and views as you navigate through your analysis.

![Timeframe selector: presets](https://dt-cdn.net/images/timeframe-selector-basic-355-f0a835da1e.png)

* The **Presets** tab lists all standard timeframes available. Select one to change your timeframe to that preset.
* The **Custom** tab displays a calendar. Click a start day, click an end day, and then click **Apply** to select that range of days as your timeframe.

  + Selected calendar intervals are set to end on start of the next day (with the time set to `00:00`). For example, if you select September 3 to September 4 on the calendar, the timeframe starts on September 3 at time `00:00` and ends on September **5** at time `00:00`, so you never miss the last minute of the time range. You can edit these displayed times.
* The **Recent** tab displays recently used timeframes. Select one to revert to that timeframe.
* The **<** and **>** controls shift the timerange forward or backward in time. The increment is the length of the original timerange. For example, if the current timerange is `Last 2 hours` (the two-hour range ending now), click **<** to shift the timerange two hours back, to `-4h to -2h` (the two-hour range ending two hours ago).
* Hover over the timeframe to see the start time, duration, and end time.

  ![Timeframe selector: hover](https://dt-cdn.net/images/timeframe-selector-hover-168-cfb13dc777.png)

Timeframe selector expressions

If you select the current timeframe in the menu bar, an editable timeframe expression is displayed.

* Reading from left to right, a timeframe expression has a start time, a `to` operator, and an end time.
* If there is no explicit end time, the `to` and `now` are implied. For example, `-2h` is the same `-2h to now`.
* Supported units: `s`, `m`, `h`, `d`, `w`, `M`, `q`, `y` (you can also use whole words such as `minutes` and `quarter`)

**Example timeframe expressions**

**Meaning**

`today`

From the beginning of today to the beginning of tomorrow.

`yesterday`

From the beginning of yesterday to the beginning of today. Like `-1d/d to today`.

`yesterday to now`

From the beginning of yesterday to the current time today.

`previous week`

The previous seven whole days. If today is Monday, you get the previous Monday through the previous Sunday (yesterday).

`this year`

The current calendar year, from January 1 of this year at `00:00` through January 1 of next year at `00:00`.

`last 6 weeks`

The last 42 days (6 weeks \* 7 days) ending now. Equivalent to `-6w to now`.

`-2h`

From 2 hours (120 minutes) ago to the current time (`now` is implied). Equivalent to `Last 2 hours` and `-2h to now`.

`-4d to -1h30m`

From 4 days (96 hours) ago to 1.5 hours ago.

`-1w`

The last 7 days (168 hours), from this time 7 days ago to the current time (`now`). Equivalent to `-7d` and `-168h`.

`-1w/w`

From the beginning of the previous calendar week to the current time (now).

* If you used `-1w/w` on a Friday afternoon at 3:00, you would get a range of 11 days 15 hours, starting with the beginning of the previous week's Monday, because `/w` rounds down to the beginning of the week.
* If you used `-1w` without `/w` on a Friday afternoon at 3:00, the start time would be exactly 7 days (168 hours) earlier: the previous Friday at 3:00 in the afternoon.

In general, `/` used in combination with a unit (such as `/d`, `/w`, `/M`, and `/y`) means to round down the date or time to the beginning of the specified time unit. For example, `-3d` means exactly 72 hours ago, whereas `-3d/d` means three days ago rounded down to the nearest day (starting at time `00:00`, the beginning of the day). Use `now/d` to mean the start of today.

`-1w/w + 8h`

Starting from the beginning of last week plus 8 hours (8:00 AM Monday).

* Note that you can use the `+` and `-` operators with units, timestamps, and `now`.

`-1d/d+9h00m to -1d/d+17h00m`

Business hours yesterday, from 09:00 - 17:00 (9 AM to 5 PM).

`2020-08-16 21:28 to 2020-08-19 10:02`

An absolute range consisting of absolute start and end dates and times in `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm` format.

* If you provide a date but omit the time (for example, just `2020-08-16`), the time is assumed to be the beginning of day (`00:00`)
* If you provide a time but omit the date (for example, just `21:28`), the date is assumed to be today

`1598545932346 to 1598837052346`

Unix epoch millisecond timestamps.

User sessions that are [live](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-session#live-vs-completed-sessions "Learn how a user session is defined, when a user session starts or ends, how user session duration is calculated, and more.") within the timeframe set in the timeframe selector are shown in the session list. The **Analysis over time** [finding](#drill-down-using-findings), on the contrary, shows only those sessions that started within the set timeframe.

For instance, if the timeframe is set for 12:00â12:05, and a session that started at 11:55 is still live during that timeframe, that session is shown in the session list but isn't considered for the **Analysis over time** finding. This is because the session started before the set timeframe.

## Drill down using findings

The findings panel is located on the left side of the **User sessions** page. This panel contains out-of-the-box findings and different visualizations for various attributes. For example, select the **Application versions** category to see which of your application version has more user sessions, or select the **Applications** category to see data on aggregated sessions for each of your applications.

![Mobile application versions on the User sessions page](https://dt-cdn.net/images/user-seesions-mobile-app-versions-1635-29a25ad4eb.png)

![Findings panel on the new user sessions page](https://dt-cdn.net/images/findings-panel-on-the-new-user-sessions-page-3342-e11184615c.png)

## Focus on sessions of an individual user

You can focus on the user sessions of a specific user. Select a user from the **User** column to navigate to that [user's overview page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/analyze-all-sessions-of-a-single-user "Learn about user behavior by analyzing the user profile (user experience score) and session activity.").

To search for user sessions of a specific user, select [**User tag**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#user-tagging "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace.") in the **Filter by** box and then choose the user you're interested in. For example, to display user sessions of a user named `Zara`, add the **User tag:** `Zara` filter. Then select **Zara** in the **User** column to navigate to this user's overview page.

![User sessions of a particular user](https://dt-cdn.net/images/user-sessions-of-a-particulra-user-2460-63bd6314da.png)

Select one of `Zara`'s sessions to view further details. For example, you can check all actions that the `Zara` user performed during the selected session. The session details contain important device-related information such as the device resolution, manufacturer, operating system, geolocation, and IP address.

![User session details page](https://dt-cdn.net/images/usmobile2-1-1438-7fd0911d36.png)

## View error details

You can also leverage session analysis to get to the details of [errors](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#error "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace.") that occur in your application.

To view the error details page

1. Go to ![Session Segmentation](https://dt-cdn.net/images/session-segmentation-512-5278e8fa16.png "Session Segmentation") **Session Segmentation**.
2. In the **Filter by** box, set **Error type** to one of the following values depending on your application type:

   | Error type | Description | Web | Mobile | Custom |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | Request error | Detected by the browser and OneAgent on your servers | Applicable | Applicable | Applicable |
   | Reported error | Manually reported via dedicated "report an error" API method | Not applicable | Applicable | Applicable |
   | Custom error | Manually reported via the RUM JavaScript API | Applicable | Not applicable | Not applicable |
   | JavaScript error | JavaScript exceptions thrown by the browser | Applicable | Not applicable | Not applicable |
3. Select the user session you're interested in to open the session details page.
4. Under **Events and actions**, expand the user action that contains an error, and select **Perform waterfall analysis**.
5. Perform one of the following actions depending on the application type:

   * Web applications On the **Waterfall analysis** page, select the **Error** tile, and then select the error. The error details page opens.
   * Mobile and custom applications Scroll down to the **Web request errors** or **Reported errors** section and select the error. The error details page opens.

#### Error details page

The error details page provides valuable information about your application's errors.

Web request error details page

Reported error details page

![Web request error details page](https://dt-cdn.net/images/web-request-error-details-page-1772-928bb94d69.png)

![Reported error details page](https://dt-cdn.net/images/reported-error-details-page-new-1644-60289f33a5.png)

This displays error details such as the estimated error count, provider (for a request error), technology (for a reported error), and more. The page also lists affected user sessions and affected user actionsâselect a user action or user session to view its details. The distribution breakdown displays information on the relative frequencies of operating systems, OS versions, application versions, and devices, while the country breakdown shows all affected countries and their corresponding error rate.

## Check sessions with rage events

When your application doesn't respond quickly, a text label looks like a button, or a toggle is hidden under another toggle, users might repeatedly click or tap the affected UI control in frustration. Dynatrace detects such behavior as a [rage event](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#rage-event "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace."): a **rage click** or a **rage tap**.

To view user sessions with rage events

1. Go to ![Session Segmentation](https://dt-cdn.net/images/session-segmentation-512-5278e8fa16.png "Session Segmentation") **Session Segmentation**.
2. Set **Filter by** to **Rage click count:** `â¥1` or **Rage tap count:** `â¥1`.
3. Select the user session you're interested in to open the session details page.
4. Scroll down to the **Events and actions** section, and expand the rage click or rage tap event to view its details.

## Examine crashes

Mobile and custom applications

When a user session ends in a [crash](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#crash "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace."), you can leverage session analysis to view the complete sequence of user actions that preceded the crash. You can also open a crash report to get all the code-level information and quickly trace the root causes of that crash.

1. Go to ![Session Segmentation](https://dt-cdn.net/images/session-segmentation-512-5278e8fa16.png "Session Segmentation") **Session Segmentation**.
2. Set **Filter by** to the following filters:

   * **Application type:** `Mobile` to display only mobile user sessions or **Application type:** `Custom` to get user sessions captured in custom applications
   * **Crashes:** `Yes` to show sessions ended with a crash
   * Mobile applications **Session Replay:** `Yes` to display sessions recorded with Session Replay on crashes for [Android](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-replay/session-replay-android "Set up Session Replay for your Android apps to learn which actions your users perform.") or [iOS](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-replay/session-replay-ios "Prerequisites and the procedure for enabling Session Replay for your iOS apps.") applications
3. Select the user session you're interested in to open its session details page.
4. Mobile applications To watch the Session Replay recording, go to the **Session Replay** tab, and select **Play** ![Replay](https://dt-cdn.net/images/replay-button-optimized-41ad05863e.svg "Replay").  
   The last event of the session is the crash, which is represented by a red dot in the timeline. Use the Session Replay controls to analyze the crash in detail.

   ![Mobile user session with Session Replay](https://dt-cdn.net/images/mobile-user-session-with-session-replay-2134-d486b7d1b9.png)
5. To view all user actions and events that preceded the crash, scroll down to the **Events and actions** section.
6. To view the crash report, expand the crash event, and then select **Open crash details**.  
   The crash report provides you with the user's device information and stack trace. You can also analyze the crash groups for your [mobile](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/analyze-and-use/crash-reports-mobile#crash-groups "Check the latest crash reports for your mobile applications.") and [custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/analyze-and-use/crash-reports-custom#crash-groups "Check the latest crash reports for your custom applications.") or download the crash stack trace.

## Analysis of a single session across different domains

For technical and security reasons, you cannot analyze a single user session across different domains.

Suppose your user visits two completely different domains during a single "session". How would Dynatrace capture this, given that both domains are instrumented with Dynatrace?

You'd actually see two separate user sessions:

1. The first session starts with the page load for the web page of the first domain, and it ends when the user clicks a link that leads them to a web page with a different domain (the second domain).
2. The second session starts with the first page load on the second domain, and it ends when any of the [criteria for ending a user session](#user-session-end) is met.

This happens for the following reasons:

* **Technical reason**: Cookies can't be shared across domains, except for subdomains.
* **Security reason**: It's a security feature of browsers and a limitation that all vendors share.

## Real-time analysis

* Access live user sessions through the **Live user activity** tile on the dashboard.

![Live user activity](https://dt-cdn.net/images/live-user-activity-1567-1df03a6ae5.png)

* Go to one of the problem pages, and select **See user sessions sample**.

![Problem details page](https://dt-cdn.net/images/user-sessions-problems-pages-1635-7fb715b445.png)

* Affected sessions can also be directly accessed from one of the problem pages.

![User sessions affected by a problem](https://dt-cdn.net/images/user-sessions-from-problems-pages-to-sessions-page-1634-805c05bb34.png)

* Bounces and conversions are available for completed user sessions.

![Conversions and bounces on the User sessions page](https://dt-cdn.net/images/user-sessions-conversions-and-bounces-1639-f3a0e84129.png)

## Examples

These examples show how you can gain insight into your users' behavior through Dynatrace user session analysis.

Filter user sessions based on user session duration

You can filter user sessions by duration: longer or shorter than a certain value or within a certain range. In the screenshot below, user sessions that have a duration of at least 10 seconds are displayed.

![Filter user sessions based on user session duration](https://dt-cdn.net/images/image005-2550-69ae07a8ad.png)

Search for all user sessions that include at least one instance of specific user actions

You can search for all user sessions that include at least one instance of any one of multiple user actions in their clickpaths.

![Search for user sessions with specific user actions](https://dt-cdn.net/images/image007-2550-ced4628b80.png)

Create complex filters

Check the filter bar in the example below. This search matches on user sessions that meet the following criteria:

* **Application type: Web** and **Browser Type: Desktop Browser**. The user accessed one of your web applications via desktop browser.
* **Duration 60s**. The session lasted at least 1 minute.
* **Action count = 5**. During the session, the user performed five actions.
* **User action name: test**. The user action called `test` occurred in the user session.

![Create complex filters](https://dt-cdn.net/images/image009-2550-759db59a94.png)

Explore categories on the findings panel

For each category on the findings panel, there's a separate section that shows visualizations and findings for that particular category. For example, **Application type** shows the current distribution, distribution over time, and geographical distribution of the different application types. The geographical map shows the color of the application type with the highest number of sessions.

![Application type category view](https://dt-cdn.net/images/image011-2122-def628c232.png)

You can choose any of the findings and easily apply them by selecting **Apply selection as a filter** in the lower-left corner of the page.

![Apply current category as a filter](https://dt-cdn.net/images/image013-2540-899b1a7298.png)

Effective user session segmentation is the key to understanding how individual users who share common characteristics experience your application.

A [user session](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-session "Learn how a user session is defined, when a user session starts or ends, how user session duration is calculated, and more."), also called a "visit," "journey," or "clickpath," is any interaction between an individual user's device and your application. Basically, it's a sequence of user actions performed by the same user in your application during a limited period of time. Each user session includes at least one [user action](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-actions "Learn what user actions are and how they help you understand what users do with your application.").

# Synthetic details for browser monitors

# Synthetic details for browser monitors

* Explanation
* 14-min read
* Updated on Jan 24, 2024

Go to **Synthetic Classic** and select a browser monitor or clickpath to view the **Synthetic details page**, which provides an overview of the monitor's execution results with visualizations, problems, and monitor properties. Powered by the Dynatrace AI engine Davis, the Synthetic details page shows you at-a-glance information, which includes trend graphs, filters, and quick links to access monitor settings, problem details, or waterfall analysis for a failing event.

![Clickpath details](https://dt-cdn.net/images/clickpathdetails-2188-0cc928c5df.png)

Learn about the new UI for browser monitor details

When you select a browser monitor in **Synthetic Classic**, you see a toggle that enables you to try out the new UI for browser monitor details. Turning on the toggle enables the new details page for all browser monitors in your environment.

![Browser monitors new UI toggle](https://dt-cdn.net/images/browsermonitordetailsnewuicta-1620-adeff8a0c3.png)

For now, you can switch back and forth between the new and old versions of the details page so you can compare them. Please use the **Share feedback** button to tell us what you think about the new design. If you dismiss the panel at the top of the details page, the panel will move to the bottom of the page.

![New UI enabled](https://dt-cdn.net/images/browsermonitordetailsctatoggleenabled-1620-687200891e.png)

## Metric visualizations

The top panel shows overall monitor [availability](#availability) or [performance](#performance) infographics for the selected timeframe. Select either infographic to go to the respective card. The **Availability** infographic shows availability percentage and any downtime for the selected timeframe. The performance infographic is customized to show your selected [**key performance metrics**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/configure-browser-monitors#kpm "Learn about configuring browser monitors and clickpaths.") along with **Total duration**.

You can also scroll through reference [screenshots](#screenshots) for each of your monitor's [script events](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/browser-clickpath-events "Learn about the event types created when recording a browser clickpath.").

Use the filter bar at the top of the page to filter all Synthetic details geographicallyâby **Continent**, **Country**, **Region**, monitoring **Location**, and **Cloud** provider.

Use the quick links in the upper-left corner to go directly to different cards in the details page or to access browser monitor settings (**Edit**, **Disable**, **Delete**). From here, you can also go to the Multidimensional analysis page to **Analyze executions**, view **Synthetic sessions** in the User sessions page for your associated application, or view an availability **Report**.

Tags applied to your browser monitor are shown below the monitor name. Select **Add tag** to apply additional tags. Note that tags can only be applied and deleted from the details page.

Purple markers above the availability or performance timelines indicate maintenance windows. Select a marker to view details of the window.

![Quick links](https://dt-cdn.net/images/clickpathdetailsinfographicsquicklinks-2190-a42e55aa2d.png)

* Whether or not you see problems and receive alert notifications during maintenance windows depends on how you [configure the maintenance windows](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/notifications-and-alerting/maintenance-windows/define-maintenance-window "Create maintenance windows and define their scope.").
* [Maintenance windows may be excluded from availability calculations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/synthetic-calculations#m-windows-availability "Understand Synthetic Monitoring metric calculations.") by applying a global setting.

### Screenshots

Reference screenshots shown in the top panel of the Synthetic details page are taken if the monitor runs successfully when the monitor is created or edited, and thereafter, once every 24 hours from a random monitoring location (including [private locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring.")). Screenshots are taken at the end of each script event (even those without timings). You can scroll through screenshots here or select an image to view enlarged versions.

![Synthetic details reference screenshots](https://dt-cdn.net/images/syntheticdetailsscreenshots-251-74aa173377.png)

Note that reference screenshots are always the most current, even when viewing Synthetic details for a historical timeframe.

When a monitor fails, screenshots for every failing execution (SCoE) are available on the [Multidimensional analysis page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/multidimensional-analysis-for-browser-monitors "Learn how to analyze browser-monitor data points.").

### Screenshot storage

To view screenshots from private Synthetic locations, your Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate and the browser you access Dynatrace from must be able to access the Amazon S3 service.

* To view screenshots taken from private Synthetic locations, ensure that your firewall allows connections to `ruxit-synth-screencap.s3.amazonaws.com`.
* To store screenshots taken from private locations, ensure access to `ruxit-synth-screencap.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com`.

  + Note that screenshots are stored in a different folder for each monitoring environment, but the S3 Bucket is the same (`ruxit-synth-screencap`). You can access the screenshots for each environment only via a direct link while logged in to the environment.
  + Data is encrypted by [Amazon S3-managed keyï»¿](https://dt-url.net/4a02xvx). This key is the same for all environments.

Visit [Can't see screenshots in browser monitor resultsï»¿](https://dt-url.net/mfw2xmb) in the Dynatrace Community for more information.

## Availability

The **Availability** card shows overall availability across all monitor locations, with annotations for global/local outages and global/local missing data (as when the monitor is disabled).

Note that a monitor can be down at one or all locations even if no [outage thresholds (global or local)](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/configure-browser-monitors#outage-handling "Learn about configuring browser monitors and clickpaths.") have been set up. The outage duration is the sum of all downtimes in the selected timeframe, not counting overlapping downtimes. See [Synthetic calculations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/synthetic-calculations "Understand Synthetic Monitoring metric calculations.") for details on how availability and downtime are calculated.

The graph shows availability for each monitor location. You can sort locations by **Location** name, **Cloud**, or **Availability**.

Time periods with availability outages are blocked in red. Hover over the **All locations** graph to view information about the number of locations with outages or missing data for any given point in time.

![Availability card](https://dt-cdn.net/images/clickpathdetailsavailability-2187-a6e3121c0f.png)

Expand **All locations** to view availability graphs for each location. Select a block of monitor downtime (red) or availability (purple) in any location's timeline and then select **Analyze** to see [Multidimensional analysis](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/multidimensional-analysis-for-browser-monitors "Learn how to analyze browser-monitor data points.") for availability filtered by that location. You can also select the location name; or select **Analyze availability** to see data points for all locations.

Select **Pin to dashboard** to pin a **Browser monitor** tile to a classic dashboard you own or a new classic dashboard.

## Performance

The **Performance** card shows trend lines for **Total duration** for **all actions** in your monitor or for your selected key performance metric for **load actions** or **XHR actions**. You can view performance split by **events** or by monitoring **locations**.

![Performance card](https://dt-cdn.net/images/clickpathdetailsperformance-2225-4fad47a8bf.png)

Note that while Total duration is calculated as a summation, key performance metric values are averages (as for **Visually complete**), calculated separately for load actions and XHR actions.

Key performance metrics

[**Key performance metrics**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/work-with-key-performance-metrics "Learn how to use the right key performance metrics to optimize user experience data for each of your applications.") enable you to choose performance goals that best fit the variable needs of each application you monitor. For example, you might want to choose User action duration to optimize the performance of a traditional web application. For other applications where the speed of user interaction is more important than the UI, you might want to optimize the time it takes for JavaScript resources to load. The default is **Visually complete** for both load and XHR actions as it measures how long it takes for the visible portion of a userâs browser to be fully rendered.

As Dynatrace captures a list of key performance metrics out of the box, you can switch your selection in monitor settings and immediately have historical data available.

How to choose or switch a key performance metric

For each browser monitor or clickpath, you can choose a different key performance metric for load actions and XHR actions in [edit mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/configure-browser-monitors#kpm "Learn about configuring browser monitors and clickpaths.") after monitor creation.

Key performance metric values example

Key performance metric values are calculated as averages. Consider a login transaction consisting of three events resulting in one load action each:

* Initial page load (1 s Visually complete)
* Click on a login button (5 s Visually complete)
* Navigate to another page (3 s Visually complete)

The **Visually complete** timing for these load actions is 3 seconds while the **Total duration** could be 9 seconds.

If you check the [Synthetic events and actions](#events-actions) card, you can see that performance is only calculated for events with timings. See [Number of actions consumed by browser clickpaths](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/number-of-actions-consumed-by-browser-clickpaths "Find out how many actions are consumed by a browser clickpath and how they differ from events.") for more information. So when viewing **all actions**, the Total duration graph excludes events with no network activity. When viewing **load actions** or **XHR actions**, you see key performance metric graphs for individual events that contain load actions and XHR actions, respectively. Note that an event can contain a combination of actions of different types, for example, two load actions and one XHR action.

Select an event or location in the legend to include or exclude it from the graph. Hover over the graph to see the performance (key performance metric or Total duration) of individual events or by location for a given point in time. Then click and select **Analyze** to see the corresponding analysis timeframe in the [Multidimensional analysis page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/multidimensional-analysis-for-browser-monitors "Learn how to analyze browser-monitor data points.") for performance, filtered by your selected action type. You can also select **Analyze performance** to see performance in the Multidimensional analysis page.

If there is a violation of the [performance threshold for the Total duration of all events](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/configure-browser-monitors#performance-thresholds "Learn about configuring browser monitors and clickpaths."), a solid red bar appears above the **all actions** graph for the duration of the problem; the threshold appears as a dotted red line. Select the solid red bar to see the locations violating the threshold and a link to the problem overview page.

![Total duration violation](https://dt-cdn.net/images/clickpathdetailstotaldurationviolation-2188-7e5789306a.png)

For a violation of an event-specific thresholds, the [Synthetic events and actions](#events-actions) card highlights the events in violation, their duration, and the thresholds involved.

## Synthetic events and actions

The **Synthetic events and actions** card helps you distinguish between script [events](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/browser-clickpath-events "Learn about the event types created when recording a browser clickpath.") with and without timings. Select **all events** or select **events with timings** and the action type (**load actions** or **XHR actions**) to filter the card. When viewing all events, you see the average Total duration of the constituent actions. When viewing events by action type, you see your selected [key performance metric](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/work-with-key-performance-metrics "Learn how to use the right key performance metrics to optimize user experience data for each of your applications.").

Events are the recorded interactions that are simulated during the playback of a browser clickpath. Not all events necessarily trigger network requests, for example, clicking an input field or entering text into a form. These events are important from a functional perspective but donât generate performance data. Events with timings, or events that trigger actions, are the basis of performance data.

![Synthetic events and actions card](https://dt-cdn.net/images/clickpathdetailseventsactionsfiltered-1090-3a1679e4fb.png)

Expand an event with timings in the event list to compare all performance metrics for constituent actions in one graph. If the event has more than one type of action, you can opt to view metrics by action type. Select a metric in the legend to include or exclude it from the performance graph. Select **Edit event** to edit the script event in monitor settings. Select **Analyze** to view the [Multidimensional analysis page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/multidimensional-analysis-for-browser-monitors "Learn how to analyze browser-monitor data points.") for performance filtered by the event.

![Synthetic event details](https://dt-cdn.net/images/clickpathdetailseventsactionsexpanded-1190-43583deb9c.png)

Dynatrace uses exactly the same technology to capture real user and synthetic data, so you can validate your synthetic monitoring results against real users easily. When a browser monitor has an associated application, Dynatrace automatically shows the real user actions for each Synthetic event with timingsâselect the **contributing actions** links. You are taken to the corresponding user action page, which you can filter for synthetic users.

![Link to real user action](https://dt-cdn.net/images/clickpathdetailslinktouseraction-2181-0c35574fed.png)

![User action page](https://dt-cdn.net/images/clickpathdetailsuseractionpage-2188-aa91dbb3a8.png)

Events are highlighted when they are in violation of their performance thresholds. Expand the event to see its timing and the violated threshold. A solid red bar appears above the stacked graph for the duration of the problem; the threshold appears as a dotted red line. Select the solid red bar to see the locations that violated the threshold and a link to the problem overview page; the corresponding problem is also shown on the [Problems card](#problems).

![Event performance violation](https://dt-cdn.net/images/clickpathdetailseventviolation-1120-65f9eefc94.png)

## Problems

The **Problems** card shows performance (threshold violation) and availability (local or global outage) problems when you enable the respective thresholds in [monitor settings](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/configure-browser-monitors "Learn about configuring browser monitors and clickpaths."). Expand the card to see active as well as resolved problems for the selected timeframe.

There are three main problem types for browser monitors:

* Global outage (availability)
* Local outage (availability)
* Performance threshold violation (performance)

Any [custom alerts](/docs/dynatrace-intelligence/root-cause-analysis/event-analysis-and-correlation/event-categories/custom-alerts "Learn more about custom alerts and the logic behind raising them.") based on user-defined thresholds are also displayed here.

![Problems card](https://dt-cdn.net/images/clickpathdetailsproblemscard-1094-0de0568223.png)

See [Synthetic calculations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/synthetic-calculations "Understand Synthetic Monitoring metric calculations.") for how availability and performance are calculated and how problems are generated and dismissed.

Select the **More** (**â¦**) button on the **Problems** card to view the same list of problems in the **Problems** page. Here you can view the frequency of open and closed problems per time slot for your selected timeframe.

![Problems page filtered by a synthetic monitor](https://dt-cdn.net/images/problemspagesyntheticmonitor-2210-d75a12d1e7.png)

Expand problem **Details** to view a problem's **Root cause** and **Alerting profiles**, which are used to determine if notifications should be sent out. All **Affected** entities that are associated with the root cause (such as a monitored service or application) are listed.

![Expanded problem details](https://dt-cdn.net/images/clickpathproblemdetails-1094-e7c03bff41.png)

Select a problem name (for example, **Multiple applicaton problems**) in the **Problems** card to view the problem overview page. Note that performance problems may combine threshold violations at the monitor as well as the event levels. Select the **Impacted** entity name (that is, the impacted synthetic monitor) to filter the details page by the problem duration.

![Synthetic monitoring problem overview page](https://dt-cdn.net/images/clickpathproblemoverviewpage-1422-4a8e3aca59.png)

![Synthetic details filtered by problem duration](https://dt-cdn.net/images/clickpathdetailsfilteredbyproblem-2191-8c40ee9c5d.png)

Problems, along with their constituent [events](#events) and any availability [errors](#errors) give you a full picture of the number and scope of your monitor's issues.

## Events

The **Events** card shows all events that can lead to problems. [Custom events](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/events-v1 "Find out what you can do with the Dynatrace Events API.") you ingest into Dynatrace also show up in this card. Events for active as well as resolved problems show up in the list and timeline.

Hover over a time slot in the event timeline to see the type and number of events generated in that interval. Select the time slot to display events within it.

Select an event type, for example, **Browser monitor performance threshold violation**, to see the list of events. There is always one slowdown event created per location where your monitor violates event-level or monitor-level performance thresholds. Select an individual event to see details.

![Events card](https://dt-cdn.net/images/clickpathdetailsevents-1275-0d7c9f6e30.png)

## Errors

The **Errors** card displays the timeline of all failed executions of the monitor with the corresponding error codes, providing an easy way to quickly find the main reason for monitor failures.

A monitor failure counts towards availability outages (global or local threshold violations). You might see errors with no [problems](#problems) if you haven't enabled availability thresholds or if the errors don't cause a violation of your availability thresholds. A performance threshold violation does not necessarily result in an error unless the monitor also fails.

Select **Analyze errors** to view executions with these errors in the [Multidimensional analysis page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/multidimensional-analysis-for-browser-monitors "Learn how to analyze browser-monitor data points."). Select **Analyze** ![Analyze](https://dt-cdn.net/images/analyze-icon-e97b8dab47.svg "Analyze") next to an individual error to view Multidimensional analysis filtered by that error.

Hover over any time slot in the error timeline to see the count of errors by type during that interval. Select **Analyze** in the tooltip to view the Multidimensional analysis page showing that time slot.

![Errors card](https://dt-cdn.net/images/clickpathdetailserrors-1263-d3eaf75cd8.png)

## Properties

The **Properties** card summarizes key properties of your monitor and displays the number of events and consumption for the selected timeframe. For single-URL browser monitors, the number of events is always 1.

![Browser monitor properties](https://dt-cdn.net/images/clickpathdetailsproperties-1091-01f1540444.png)

## World map

The world map shows if your monitoring locations are online or have an outage, helping you distinguish between global and local outages. Select a location on the map to see availability at that location for the timeframe and the status of the last execution (for example, **Outage**). Next, select **Analyze executions** to see the [Multidimensional analysis page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/multidimensional-analysis-for-browser-monitors "Learn how to analyze browser-monitor data points.") for availability filtered by that location.

**Assign monitor to application** (see the first image below) takes you to monitor settings where you can [associate the monitor with one of your monitored web applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/configure-browser-monitors#assigned-applications "Learn about configuring browser monitors and clickpaths."). If [Real User Monitoring (RUM)](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/rum-overview "Learn about Real User Monitoring, key performance metrics, mobile app monitoring, and more.") is enabled for the applications your synthetic monitor runs against, Dynatrace automatically links the RUM applications to the monitor, and the **Monitored applications** card is displayed (see the second image below). You can see the key metrics of the application and can jump directly to RUM data from here.

If a RUM application is linked to the monitor, youâll see a toggle to augment the world map with RUM data. When there's an outage at a synthetic location, you can immediately compare the RUM traffic. The RUM data is also a good indicator of which other locations you should run your synthetic monitor from.

![World map with Synthetic locations](https://dt-cdn.net/images/syntheticdetailsworldmap1-633-816e0ba257.png)

# HTTP monitors reporting results

# HTTP monitors reporting results

* Explanation
* 13-min read
* Updated on Nov 27, 2023

Go to **Synthetic Classic** and select an HTTP monitor to open the **Synthetic details page**, which provides an overview of monitor execution results, result visualizations, and monitor properties. Powered by the Dynatrace AI engine Davis, the Synthetic details page shows you at-a-glance information and graphs, with ready links and filters to drill right down to problem details and edit monitor settings.

![HTTP monitor details](https://dt-cdn.net/images/httpmonitordetails1-1794-d60c8a1236.png)

## Metric visualizations

The top panel shows overall monitor [availability](#availability) and [performance](#performance) infographics for the selected timeframe.

Use the filter bar at the top of the page to filter all HTTP details by one or more locations.

Select the quick links in the upper-left corner to go directly to different cards in the details page or to access HTTP monitor settings (**Edit**, **Disable**, **Delete**). [**Analyze execution details**](#analyze-last-execution) displays the results of the most recent successful and failed executions per location in JSON format.

Tags applied to your HTTP monitor are shown below the monitor name. Select **Add tag** to apply additional tags. Note that tags can only applied and deleted from the details page.

Purple bars above the availability or performance timelines indicate maintenance windows.

![HTTP details with maintenance window](https://dt-cdn.net/images/httpdetailsmw1-1889-5247b78e7d.png)

* Whether or not you see problems and receive alert notifications during maintenance windows depends on how you [configure the maintenance windows](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/notifications-and-alerting/maintenance-windows/define-maintenance-window "Create maintenance windows and define their scope.").
* [Maintenance windows may be excluded from availability calculations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/synthetic-calculations#m-windows-availability "Understand Synthetic Monitoring metric calculations.") by applying a global setting.

## Availability

The availability infographics at the top of the page display the monitor's availability for the selected timeframe, with details of downtime and affected locations, if any. Outage (downtime) duration and affected locations infographics are displayed if the monitor is down (unavailable) at one or more locations. The number of affected locations is also displayed if there's no data from any locations for any reason.

Note that a monitor can be down at one or all locations even if no [outage thresholds (global or local)](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/configure-http-monitors-classic#outage-handling "Learn about configuring HTTP monitors.") have been set up. The outage duration is the sum of all downtimes in the selected timeframe, not counting overlapping downtimes. See [Synthetic calculations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/synthetic-calculations "Understand Synthetic Monitoring metric calculations.") for details on how availability and downtime are calculated.

The **Availability** card shows overall availability across all monitor locations, with annotations for global/local outages and global/local missing data (as when the monitor is disabled).

Hover over the **All locations** graph to view information about the number of locations with outages or missing data at any given point in time. Expand **All locations** to view availability graphs for each location. Select a block of monitor downtime (red) or availability (purple) in any availability timeline and then select **Analyze** to filter all HTTP details by the duration of that block.

Select **Pin to dashboard** to pin an **HTTP monitor** tile to a classic dashboard you own or a new classic dashboard.

![HTTP monitor availability](https://dt-cdn.net/images/httpdetailsavailability1-1891-b5151c0d2d.png)

## Performance

The performance infographic at the top of the details page displays the HTTP monitor's average performance, that is, response time for the sum of all requests across all locations for the selected timeframe. Additional metrics are captured per request and are shown in the [requests card](#http-requests).

The **Performance** card shows trend lines for minimum and maximum response time for the sum of all requests, with the shaded area representing the difference between the two values at any given time. Note that if your monitor runs from a single location, the minimum and maximum trend lines coincide.

![HTTP monitor performance](https://dt-cdn.net/images/httpdetailsperformanceminmax2-2216-152212e727.png)

Optionally, view trend lines for the average sum of all requests **Response time by location** or average **Response time by request** across all locations.

If the monitor violates a [performance threshold](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/configure-http-monitors-classic#performance-thresholds "Learn about configuring HTTP monitors."), whether for the sum of all requests or an individual request, a solid red line appears above the performance graph for the problem duration. Additionally, any threshold for the sum of all requests appears as a dotted red line. Select the solid red bar to display a link to the problem overview page.

![HTTP monitor performance problem](https://dt-cdn.net/images/httpdetailsperformanceviolation2-2217-2a18a384e0.png)

## Analyze execution details

Select **Analyze execution details** at the top of the details page or **Analyze last failed execution** in the **Failed requests** card to view the most recent successful, failed, and [on-demand executions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/on-demand-executions "Execute synthetic monitors on demand from public or private locations") of the HTTP monitor per location in JSON format. Select [**Executions difference**](#filters) to view the color-coded difference between the last successful, failed, or on-demand executions.

Any response body and captured [HTTP metrics](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/http-monitor-metrics-classic "Learn about the performance metrics collected for HTTP monitors.") are also displayed along with the HTTP status code per request. If the monitor contains [credentials](/docs/manage/credential-vault "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.") sent in the request URL, HTTP header values, or request body, the JSON only displays the credential ID in the corresponding element. (This feature requires ActiveGate version 1.229.)

You can limit the display of sensitive information (such as credentials returned in the response body) in execution details by selecting **Do not store and display request and response bodies, header values, and peer certificate details in execution details** in [monitor settings](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/configure-http-monitors-classic "Learn about configuring HTTP monitors.").

You need to do this for each request you wish to limit the display of. Request and response bodies, values of request and response headers, and peer certificate details are then replaced by placeholder text.

![Execution details hidden fields](https://dt-cdn.net/images/analyze-execution-details-hidden-948-0e70ad67cb.png)

For successful or failed executions, the tabs hold JSON data for all locations. [Use the filters](#filters) at the top or the left of each tab to filter execution details. You can view and **Download** the corresponding filtered JSON file for successful or failed executions. For on-demand executions, you can download the JSON file for the single selected execution. You can also **Copy** your environment URL for retrieving JSON files via API. Note that GET API calls for fetching synthetic monitor executions require API tokens.

![Download JSON and API link](https://dt-cdn.net/images/http-analyze-execution-download-1889-126037a9ff.png)

The `customLogs` attribute displays the timestamp, log level, and message for each custom log line defined using the `api.info()`, `api.warn()`, `api.fail()`, or `api.error()` [scripting methods](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/pre-and-post-scripting-for-http-monitors-classic "Learn how to apply pre and post scripts to your requests"). (This feature requires Dynatrace version 1.255+ on public locations and ActiveGate version 1.255+ on private locations.)

![customLogs attribute](https://dt-cdn.net/images/http-analyze-execution-customlogs-2182-b4164106c0.png)

The **On-demand execution** tab is overwritten with each on-demand execution. Use the dropdown list to select any on-demand execution for the monitor from the preceding six hours. If the on-demand executions are in [**Standard** or **Disable problem detection** modes](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/on-demand-executions#ui "Execute synthetic monitors on demand from public or private locations"), details are also written to the last failed/successful execution tabs. Note that in these modes, if you fail a monitor for violating a performance threshold, the execution appears in the tabs for successful and on-demand executions.

### Filters and comparisions

Use the filter bar at the top and left of each tab to narrow down execution detailsâyou can have different filters for each tab. You can select from provided options to filter by **Locations**, **Requests**, and JSON **Attributes** (either individually or in groupsâsee below).

![Filtered JSON](https://dt-cdn.net/images/analyze-last-execution-filters2-1600-0085726604.png)

In the top filter bar, you can also search for specific contentâsimply enter the string (not case sensitive) to look for. In the left bar, you can search for specific filter criteria.

![Filters and search fields](https://dt-cdn.net/images/analyze-last-execution-filters-945-b19d004f3d.png)

The **Executions difference** tab enables you to view a color-coded, object-by-object comparison of two executionsâthe last failed and successful executions for each assigned location or any on-demand execution within the last six hours. Any filters apply to both compared executionsâthis is especially useful to compare executions by an entire attribute group like **Execution** (see below).

![Filter and compare executions](https://dt-cdn.net/images/http-analyze-execution-compare1-2215-e9094d193a.png)

## Response size

The **Response size** card shows trend lines for minimum and maximum response size for the sum of all requests, with any shaded area representing the difference between the two values at any given time. The trend lines might coincide (as shown below), as when your monitor runs from a single location. However, response size might vary, for example, when different responses are sent based on location.

![Min and max response size for all requests taken together](https://dt-cdn.net/images/httpdetailsresponsesize-1119-5f3f338a3e.png)

To track such differences, you can **Show response size breakdown per location**. Note that if you filter the entire details page by any locations, the toggle is no longer available.

![Response size by location](https://dt-cdn.net/images/httpdetailsresponsesizelocation-1119-d2c9b6eae0.png)

## HTTP requests

An HTTP monitor can consist of one or multiple HTTP requests. The **HTTP requests** card gives you an overview of all executed requests, their order, name, request URL, and the HTTP method used. For each request, the **HTTP requests** card splits performance (**Response time**) by the following metrics (see more in [HTTP monitor metrics](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/http-monitor-metrics-classic "Learn about the performance metrics collected for HTTP monitors.")):

* **DNS lookup time**
* **TCP connect time**
* **TLS handshake time**
* **Waiting**
* **Download**

**Response time** is the summation of these different metrics.

Expand a request from the list to view all performance metrics in one chart. Select a metric in the legend to remove/add it to the performance chart. Select **Edit request** to go to monitor settings from this card.

![HTTP requests card](https://dt-cdn.net/images/httpdetailsrequests2-1096-3c247f0d9a.png)

The **Status codes** tab shows the timeline of returned HTTP status codes for a particular request. (The [HTTP status codes card](#status-codes) shows the returned HTTP status codes for your HTTP monitor as a whole.)

When a request is in violation of its [event-specific performance threshold](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/configure-http-monitors-classic#performance-thresholds "Learn about configuring HTTP monitors."), it is highlighted in red. Expand the request to see the performance timings and the threshold violated. A solid red line appears above the stacked graph for the problem duration; the request threshold appears as a dotted red line. Select the solid red bar to display a link to the problem overview page.

![HTTP request performance violation](https://dt-cdn.net/images/httpdetailsrequestviolation2-1096-dbe95d7ef3.png)

## Properties

This informational card shows the number of requests, locations, frequency of monitor execution, and any applied tags. You can also see the consumption of DEM units in the selected timeframe. Select **Add tag** to apply additional tags. Note that tags can only applied and deleted from the details page.

![HTTP monitor properties](https://dt-cdn.net/images/httpdetailsproperties1-946-1650cc087c.png)

## Services

The **Services** card displays any monitored services that are automatically associated with the HTTP monitor. This card appears when the HTTP endpoint being monitored is hosted on a OneAgent-monitored host and the endpoint URL is handled by one of the discovered services. The association between the HTTP monitor and the service is made based on data provided by OneAgent. Therefore, at least one monitor execution needs to be completed before a service can be associated with the monitor. Select the link for a displayed service to view the service overview page, filtered by the HTTP monitor.

![Services card](https://dt-cdn.net/images/httpdetailsservice-931-dc29452459.png)

## Monitored applications

HTTP monitors enable you to monitor internal resources and API endpoints, for example, for key backend APIs for login or search operations used by your mobile apps. You can link such HTTP monitors to the monitored mobile, web, or custom applications. Select **Assign monitor to application**. (You can link an application directly in [monitor settings](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/configure-http-monitors-classic#setup "Learn about configuring HTTP monitors.").)

![Link an application](https://dt-cdn.net/images/httpdetailslinkapp2-1102-1f74517f99.png)

If [Real User Monitoring (RUM)](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/rum-overview "Learn about Real User Monitoring, key performance metrics, mobile app monitoring, and more.") is enabled for the applications your synthetic monitor runs against, Dynatrace automatically links the RUM applications to the monitor, and the **Monitored applications** card is displayed. You can see the key metrics of the application and jump directly to RUM data from here.

After you've linked an HTTP monitor to an application, synthetic monitor availability is displayed directly in application details, and Davis automatically associates detected synthetic monitoring problems with the linked application.

Note that you cannot block Synthetic Monitoring traffic for RUM applications by [excluding bots, spiders, or the IP addresses of Synthetic locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/exclude-browsers-robots-and-spiders-from-monitoring "Disable Real User Monitoring for certain IP addresses, browsers, bots, and spiders.").

## Problems

The **Problems** card shows performance (threshold violation) and availability (local or global outage) problems when you enable the respective thresholds in [monitor settings](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/configure-http-monitors-classic "Learn about configuring HTTP monitors."). Expand the card to see active as well as resolved problems for the selected timeframe.

See [Configure HTTP monitors](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/configure-http-monitors-classic "Learn about configuring HTTP monitors.") for information on how to define performance and availability thresholds. See [Synthetic calculations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/synthetic-calculations "Understand Synthetic Monitoring metric calculations.") for how availability and performance are calculated and how problems are generated and dismissed. See the [Synthetic alerting overview](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/synthetic-alerting-overview "Learn about synthetic alerting concepts and workflow.") for alerting workflow and concepts, including setting up notification profiles and templates.

There are three main problem types for HTTP monitors:

* Global outage (availability)
* Local outage (availability)
* Performance threshold violation (performance problem for sum of all requests or individual requests)

![Problems card](https://dt-cdn.net/images/httpdetailsproblemcard-1101-2caea72d30.png)

* Performance problems may combine threshold violations at the monitor as well as request levels.
* Concurrently occurring problems may be combined into a single problem (**Multiple application problems**).

Select a problem to view the problem overview page. Drill further into the problem to see the HTTP details page filtered by the problem duration.

![Global outage problem](https://dt-cdn.net/images/httpmonitorglobaloutageproblemoverview-2245-2f1faed1ee.png)

Problems, along with their constituent [events](#events) and any corresponding [status codes](#status-codes) give you a full picture of the number and scope of your monitor's issues.

![Problems, events, and status codes](https://dt-cdn.net/images/httpdetailsproblemseventsstatuscodes-1098-a25c0151da.png)

## Events

The **Events** card shows all events that compose problems. Events for active as well as resolved problems show up in the list and timeline.

Hover over a time slot in the event timeline to see the type and number of events generated in that interval. Select a time slot to view a tooltip with the events that took place in it.

Select an event type, for example, **HTTP monitor location slowdown**, to see the list of events. There is always one slowdown event created per location where your monitor violates request- or monitor-level performance thresholds. Select an individual event to see details.

The [`api.fail()` method](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/pre-and-post-scripting-for-http-monitors-classic#end "Learn how to apply pre and post scripts to your requests") can be used to define a custom **Failure message** that appears in the Events card in case of failure. Custom log messages also appear in the `customLogs` attribute in [HTTP monitor execution details](#analyze-last-execution).

![Event type selected](https://dt-cdn.net/images/httpdetailseventtype2-1114-d6b38983d6.png)

## Failed requests

The **Failed requests** card shows the count of every failed request in your HTTP monitor executions within the selected timeframe, broken down by request name and error code. The timeline graph shows the count of error codesâhover over any time slot to see the count of different status codes in that interval. Select an error code in the legend to hide/show it in the graph.

Select a request name to edit it in [monitor settings](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/configure-http-monitors-classic "Learn about configuring HTTP monitors."). Select [**Analyze last failed execution**](#analyze-last-execution) to see the most recent failed and successful executions in JSON format.

![Failed requests card](https://dt-cdn.net/images/httpdetailsfailedrequests-945-1510d2a6e1.png)

Note that a monitor that experiences downtime due to failed requests will only trigger outage problems when outage thresholds have been set up.

## HTTP status codes

The **HTTP status codes** card displays the timeline of returned HTTP status codes for your HTTP monitor executions as a whole, which is the status code for the last executed request in the monitor, whether successful or failed. If your monitor has multiple requests, say, three, and the monitor fails at the second request, the third request is not executed. The status code reported is for the second request.

Hover over any time slot in the timeline to see the count of different status codes during that interval. Select a status code in the legend to hide/show it in the graph.

![HTTP status codes](https://dt-cdn.net/images/httpdetailsstatuscodes-1252-7aa23ff4a8.png)

# Waterfall graphs

# Waterfall graphs

* Explanation
* 11-min read
* Updated on Feb 26, 2024

Sometimes it's necessary to analyze individual browser monitor executions to understand the impact of certain locations, local CDN partners, or other variables. Waterfall analysis is a great tool for viewing detailed information about the various resources that comprise a specific load or XHR action in an execution.

A waterfall graph is a graphical display of every request and resource downloaded for an action, which can be an entire page load (load action) or the update of a specific in-page context without navigating to a new URL (XHR action). Resource- and page-level analysis is based on [W3C timings](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-action-metrics "Learn what metrics Dynatrace calculates for user actions and find out what each metric indicates.").

Waterfall graphs are available on the Synthetic [**Multidimensional analysis** page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/multidimensional-analysis-for-browser-monitors "Learn how to analyze browser-monitor data points.") for every [action](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/number-of-actions-consumed-by-browser-clickpaths "Find out how many actions are consumed by a browser clickpath and how they differ from events.") in events with timings in browser monitor [executions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/multidimensional-analysis-for-browser-monitors#data-points "Learn how to analyze browser-monitor data points.") (both single URL and clickpaths).

Used in conjunction with the [scatter plot](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/multidimensional-analysis-for-browser-monitors#scatter-plot "Learn how to analyze browser-monitor data points.") and filters on the **Multidimensional analysis** page, waterfall graphs can help you narrow down the specific resources in specific executions that are causing failures or performance violations. [Top findings](#findings) for each waterfall abstract waterfall data into accessible and actionable information.

The images below show waterfall graphs for a load and XHR action respectively.

![Load action waterfall](https://dt-cdn.net/images/waterfallloadaction1-1205-086b74aa33.png)

![XHR action waterfall](https://dt-cdn.net/images/waterfallxhraction1-1274-efc6bcbdc0.png)

Failed executions can have waterfall graphs for constituent actions up to the point when the monitor failed. Depending on the event in which failure occurs and the error type, you can find waterfall graphs even for monitors with 0% availability, and, consequently, no monitor-level performance data.

## Understand the data in waterfall graphs

The initial entry in a waterfall graph (**Loading of page** in a load action or a URL in an XHR action) shows the overall **user action duration**. The user action duration is also represented by the vertical timing line **A**.

See [Troubleshoot MV3-related issues in browser monitors](#troubleshoot-mv3) for information on the impact of transitioning the Synthetic Recorder (a Chrome browser extension) to Manifest Version 3, which is the latest iteration of the Chrome extension platform.

Hover over the entry to see additional information on the **Number of resources** downloaded or distinct **URLs** contacted. (Check [findings](#findings) for the number of first- and third-party resources.)

![First entry in a load action waterfall](https://dt-cdn.net/images/waterfallloadactionloadingofpage-1112-882a1717d2.png)

![First entry in an XHR action waterfall](https://dt-cdn.net/images/waterfallxhractionfirstentry-1174-cd6dcb60a3.png)

The waterfall graph organizes its main entries into three categories, [Document requests](#document-requests), [XHR requests](#xhr-requests), and [Resource requests](#resources). Hover over a request or resource to see the full URL.

### Document requests

For load actions, which load the entire page, this section lists the base page and any content displayed in frames. The initial request, usually the base page, is highlighted in purple. For XHR actions, this section generally shows document requests in iframes.

Base page timings are the basis of the page-level vertical timing lines displayed on the chart. For example, the start of base page load time marks the W3C Navigation start metric (the vertical timing line **N**). Load actions have a different set of [page-level timing events](#filters) compared to XHR actions.

If there's a redirect in place for the page you navigate to, the document request and resources for the page you are redirected to are shown.

Hover over the entry to see a breakdown of its load time into components. The Processing, OnDOMContentLoaded, and OnLoad components are only applicable to the base page.

Dynatrace Synthetic Monitoring includes processing time in its waterfall display and calculation. Processing time, which is time spent in JavaScript execution or simply browser overhead, is represented by the gap between the end of one resource and the start of another. Processing time is shown as a component of base page load time.

![Base page](https://dt-cdn.net/images/waterfallloadactionbasepage1-1406-9cc7f0b23f.png)

### XHR requests

Load actions as well as XHR actions can contain XHR/fetch calls, or resource requests that do not result in a complete page load. An example of generating XHRs is typing into a form field and seeing autocomplete suggestions that change dynamically as you type.

The initial XHR in an XHR action is highlighted in purple, and its timings are displayed as page-level timings in vertical lines. XHR actions have a different set of [page-level timing events](#filters) compared to load actions.

XHR entries display W3C resource timings as well as any JavaScript callback timesâin the Callback component. The Callback component is only applicable to XHRs.

![Component timings for an XHR](https://dt-cdn.net/images/waterfallxhractioninitialcomponenttimings-586-2be36bf9a7.png)

### Resource requests

Resources are listed in the order requested and indented to show the offset from the start of page navigation when each was called. Check the [top-most entry](#waterfall-data) in a waterfall graph to view the total number of resources downloaded; check [findings](#findings) to view the breakdown by first and third parties.

Each resource's download time and its components are shown in relation to that of other resources and in the context of overall page-level W3C timings. Hover over a resource to see timing details.

Resources can be [grouped and filtered](#filters).

Failed resources are marked in red. Hover over the resource for an explanation. Note that a failed resource does not necessarily result in action or monitor failure.

![Failed resource request](https://dt-cdn.net/images/waterfallfailedresource1-589-cca3366f7a.png)

If you have blocked requests to specified domains/URLs/resource types in [monitor settings](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/configure-browser-monitors#advanced-setup "Learn about configuring browser monitors and clickpaths."), resources from such domains are shown without detailed timings.

![Blocked request](https://dt-cdn.net/images/waterfallblockedrequest-628-61d68bd691.png)

You can plot the performance (**HTML downloaded** / **Response end**) of any request, including document and XHR requests, across data points in the [scatter plot](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/multidimensional-analysis-for-browser-monitors#scatter-plot "Learn how to analyze browser-monitor data points.") by selecting **Analyze over time**.

![Analyze a request over time](https://dt-cdn.net/images/scatterplotanalyzeovertime-1619-07e12cf69a.png)

## Findings

Davis, the Dynatrace AI causation engine, automatically detects top findings for each waterfall. Findings are key statistics and tips that capture how resources can impact page-level W3C timings of the initial request of an actionâthe base page in the case of load actions or the initial XHR in the case of XHR actions. Initial requests drive the first impressions of new visitors. Top findings are tools that help you identify which resources can be optimized, such as the resources impacting Visually complete (the user's above-the-fold experience), uncompressed text resources, large resources, or slow CDN resources.

Select **Show all findings** to expand the list of findings above a waterfall. Select a finding to highlight the associated resources in the waterfall graph.

![Top findings expanded](https://dt-cdn.net/images/waterfalltopfinding-1196-54e42a27e5.png)

The **Visually complete** finding compares the action timing to any configured threshold and highlights any images that impact the metric. (Thresholds and timeouts can be configured in browser monitor settings: **Advanced setup** > **Enable custom RUM JavaScript settings** > **Configure parameters for Visually complete and Speed index calculation**.)

![Visually complete finding](https://dt-cdn.net/images/waterfallvcfinding-650-f2d19da580.png)

Another finding highlights uncompressed text resources; if an uncompressed text resource is larger than 860 bytes, the hover data on compression is highlighted in red. This threshold may be configurableâ[see below](#finding-thresholds).

![Uncompressed resource](https://dt-cdn.net/images/waterfalluncompressedresource-586-e65284b928.png)

### Thresholds for waterfall findings

If Real User Monitoring (RUM) is enabled for the web applications your browser monitor runs against, you can specify thresholds for waterfall findings in application settings.

You can also find default values for findings here. For example, you can determine how to peg **Speed index** to **Visually complete** or how large is too large when it comes to being warned about the size of resources.

To configure waterfall finding thresholds

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **Capturing** > **Advanced setup**.
5. Adjust the required thresholds under **Waterfall finding thresholds**.

### PurePathÂ® distributed traces for visibility into application infrastructure

The **Traces** finding is displayed when your browser monitor runs against a web application with a [OneAgent](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-oneagent "Understand the important concepts related to OneAgent and find out how to install and operate OneAgent on different platforms.") instance installed on the server side and that has the relevant server-side monitoring. The finding displays the linked service calls. If the monitor is associated with a web application that doesn't have the relevant server-side monitoring, the **Traces** finding is not displayed, as there are no underlying monitored services.

PurePathÂ® technology traces a web request through your application infrastructure so you can see what is driving performance behind the scenes at the application level. If you see that one or two requests are taking the majority of the time on a slow page, you can drill into the distributed trace to see, for example, if there are too many database requests or just one slow request. You can then use this information to drive performance improvements or error analysis.

When you select the finding, the associated requests and resources are highlighted in the waterfall. You can select the link provided in the top finding to access all available distributed traces or hover over an individual request to drill into a specific distributed trace. You'll probably want to analyze distributed traces for your [dynamic requests](/docs/discover-dynatrace/get-started/glossary#request "Get acquainted with Dynatrace terminology."), ([document requests](#document-requests), or [XHRs](#xhr-requests)) rather than individual resources. In the image below, hovering over the document request displays the **View trace** link for that request.

![Traces top finding and single request Purepath trace](https://dt-cdn.net/images/waterfalltracesfinding-1121-556a6c6eed.png)

In the **Distributed traces** list view, select a resource/request and drill down to view **Trace**.

![Traces accessed from Synthetic waterfall](https://dt-cdn.net/images/tracesfromwaterfall-1491-340c596da0.png)

* For processes that are under heavy load, Dynatrace OneAgent automatically adjusts the data sent. Therefore, certain distributed traces may not be available. In such cases, you'll see a message about [Adaptive Traffic Management](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-oneagent/adaptive-traffic-management "Dynatrace Adaptive Traffic Management provides dynamic sampling to ensure that the amount of capture traces stays within the Full-Stack Monitoring included trace volume.") in the **Traces** finding.

* Drilling down from an individual resource (based on W3C resource timings) to a distributed trace (captured by OneAgent) is enabled by comparing URLs. If there are any rewrite rules or if parts of the URL arenât identical on the client and server sides, the **View trace** button for the resource wonât be displayed. In such cases, you can get to all your distributed traces from the **Traces** finding.

## JavaScript errors

You can analyze the details of JavaScript errors that are detected during the execution of load or XHR actions. JavaScript errors appear as red vertical markers in the waterfall graph at the point they occurred during the execution. Click a marker to analyze the details of that error. JavaScript errors do not lead to monitor failure, and monitor failure is not directly attributable to any JavaScript errors.

![Waterfall JavaScript error](https://dt-cdn.net/images/waterfalljserror-1198-234304aad2.jpg)

When you filter the [scatter plot](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/multidimensional-analysis-for-browser-monitors#scatter-plot "Learn how to analyze browser-monitor data points.") for JavaScript errors, you can click any data point to automatically select the event and load the waterfall where a JavaScript error occurs.

The Error details page for each detected JavaScript error includes a complete stack trace that identifies the exact line of code responsible for the error. This insight can dramatically accelerate the time it takes to resolve such errors.

![JavaScript error details](https://dt-cdn.net/images/jserrordetails-1680-b4b1d8ef5d.jpg)

## Grouping, filters, and legend

Grouping and filtering tools help you focus on the waterfall requests that matter to you. You can combine grouping and filtering controls.

**Grouping by domain** organizes resources into first-party, third-party, and CDN domains. You can see the load order and timing details for specific domains.

**Grouping by type** allows you to see the main categories of first-party, third-party, and CDN resourcesâimage, script (JavaScript), CSS, and others.

![Group resources by type](https://dt-cdn.net/images/waterfallgroupbytype1-1206-c6a1a11b85.png)

Note that the group-level timings represent the end-to-end timings for loading the resources of a given type/domain; these timings are not additive, in that individual resource times do not add up to group-level timings, as resources can be loaded concurrently.

Filters allow you to focus on resources that most impact your user experience. You can view the full waterfall, or **Focus on** just those resources up until significant browser events such as DOM interactive or Visually complete.

![Filter resources by browser event](https://dt-cdn.net/images/waterfallfilterbyevent1-1203-ad6b72b76f.png)

The legend at the bottom of the waterfall lists the following with detailed descriptions below:

* W3C page-level metrics
* JavaScript errors
* Resource timing components

Select any of these to exclude/include them from the waterfall graph. The images below show the browser events and resource timing components available for load actions and XHR actions, respectively.

![Legend for load actions](https://dt-cdn.net/images/legend1loadactionwaterfall-1112-ee3b169f08.png)

## Troubleshooting MV3-related issues in browser monitors

The Dynatrace Synthetic Recorder, which is a Google Chrome browser extension, is transitioning to Manifest Version 3 (MV3), which is the latest iteration of the Chrome extension platform. As a result of this required transition, there are changes in the operation of the Synthetic Recorder that might require workarounds in your browser monitor configurations or application code.

# Create a single-URL browser monitor

# Create a single-URL browser monitor

* How-to guide
* 3-min read
* Updated on Aug 19, 2025

Synthetic monitoring gives you the option of creating two kinds of browser monitorsâsingle-URL and clickpathsâto check the availability and performance of your web application at regular intervals. Single-URL browser monitors conduct availability tests of a single page of your website or web application. You also have the option of checking performance.

## Create a single-URL browser monitor

1. Go to **Synthetic Classic**.
2. Select **Create a synthetic monitor** at top right > **Create a browser monitor**.
3. On the Configure a browser monitor page, type in the **URL** you want to monitor and either use the default **Name** or provide your own.

   To enhance synthetic monitor security, Dynatrace blocks monitors from sending requests to a local host (for example, `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`).
4. Select **Add tag** to apply manually created tags to the monitor. You can choose from autocomplete suggestions as you type or create your own. (After the monitor has been created, you can manage tags from the [Synthetic details page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/synthetic-details-for-browser-monitors "Analyze browser monitor and clickpath results on the Synthetic details page.").
5. [Configure your monitor](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/configure-browser-monitors "Learn about configuring browser monitors and clickpaths.") appropriately, including selecting the profile of your emulated device, authentication, and other settings.

   ![Configure a browser monitor](https://dt-cdn.net/images/configurebrowsermonitor1-1665-749a574062.png)

   Web form authentication is no longer supported for the single-URL browser monitors. You can instead create [browser clickpath](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/record-a-browser-clickpath "Learn how to record a browser clickpath to monitor the availability and performance of your application.") monitors for the test scenarios that require web form login. Your previously configured single-URL monitors will run as before, but we recommend to re-record them as clickpaths to clearly separate each step of the login process.

   Re-recording is required if you want to modify any part of your monitor's configuration. You can no longer save changes in their current format.

   Starting from Dynatrace version 1.324+, the single-URL monitors with the web form login will be automatically updated by adding a free JavaScript step to support the login process.
6. Choose **Next** to continue configurationâselect monitor locations and frequency. See [Configure browser monitors](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/configure-browser-monitors "Learn about configuring browser monitors and clickpaths.") for details.

   ![Monitor frequency and locations](https://dt-cdn.net/images/syntheticfrequencylocations2-2223-297d2c4656.png)
7. Select **Next** at the bottom of the page to view the monitor summary.
8. On the Summary page, you can review and change your configuration (**Change URL or name**; **Change configuration**).

   ![Single-URL browser monitor summary](https://dt-cdn.net/images/summarysingleurl-2246-6f4d67b798.png)
9. At the bottom of the page, select **Create browser monitor**. Within a few minutes, you'll [receive monitoring data](#view-the-analytics-of-a-browser-monitor) for your new browser monitor.

While you cannot play back a single-URL browser monitor locally, you can [execute it on demand](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/on-demand-executions "Execute synthetic monitors on demand from public or private locations") from assigned locations.

## View the analytics of a browser monitor

1. Go to **Synthetic Classic**.
2. Optional Select **Browser** in the left menu to filter by single-URL browser monitors.
3. From the list of monitors, select the browser monitor you want to examine. You're directed to the [Synthetic details page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/synthetic-details-for-browser-monitors "Analyze browser monitor and clickpath results on the Synthetic details page.") for the browser monitor.

The details page of each monitor provides detailed results, for example, availability metrics and problems detected.

## Disable or delete a browser monitor

Monitors are enabled by default when you create them.

Disabling a synthetic monitor suspends further executions but retains the monitor and its measurement data. Any open performance and availability problems time out when a monitor is disabled (see [Synthetic calculations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/synthetic-calculations "Understand Synthetic Monitoring metric calculations.") for details). Deletion removes a monitor and its associated measurement data; this is irreversible. Before deleting a monitor, we recommend that you disable it first and ensure that you no longer require its measurement data.

To disable or delete a monitor

1. Go to **Synthetic Classic**.
2. Opt to view your monitors in list format.
3. Select the check box for the monitor you want to delete or disable.
4. Select **Delete** or **Disable** in the lower-left corner.

   ![Disable browser monitor](https://dt-cdn.net/images/disabledeletemonitor1-891-3c3e768323.png)

You can also disable or delete a monitor from the [details page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/synthetic-details-for-browser-monitors "Analyze browser monitor and clickpath results on the Synthetic details page.").

1. Go to **Synthetic Classic**.
2. Select the monitor you're interested in.
3. Select the **Browse** button (**â¦**) and select either **Disable** or **Delete**.

[Synthetic monitor execution may be disabled during a maintenance window](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/synthetic-calculations#m-windows-availability "Understand Synthetic Monitoring metric calculations.") in maintenance window settings.

# Synthetic architecture and communication

# Synthetic architecture and communication

* Explanation
* 3-min read
* Published Feb 27, 2025

Understand synthetic architecture and how your data securely flows through it. Learn about its main components and how they fit together to make everything work smoothly. By looking at the data flow, you can see how information moves around and gets processed and encrypted, ensuring the system runs efficiently.

## Architecture components

The following components are involved in the synthetic communication flow:

* **Dynatrace Cluster**âhosts the Synthetic monitors configuration, schedules monitors executions for private locations, and sends monitor configuration to public infrastructure if necessary.
* **Private location**âgroup of Synthetic ActiveGates, assigned to your monitor. The Dynatrace Cluster schedules executions for a private location.
* **ActiveGate**âcomponent used by the Synthetic engine to register and communicate with The Dynatrace Cluster.
* **Synthetic public infrastructure**âinfrastructure responsible for public location scheduling and configuration.
* **Public location**âgroup of Synthetic engines, assigned to your monitor. The Synthetic public infrastructure schedules executions for a public location.
* **Synthetic engine**âengine responsible for monitoring executions.
* **Beacon forwarder**âforwards the results from Synthetic engines to The Dynatrace Cluster.

![Architecture and communication for Synthetic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-architecture-and-communication-2500-c31e40f6b2.webp)

## Communication and data flow

Depending on the location you use, the data flow varies. With the support of the diagram above, see how communication works for both private and public locations, and how tokens are involved in the process.

Each number corresponds to a step in the diagram above.

Private location communication

Public location communication

1. **Dynatrace Cluster to ActiveGate**

   The cluster provides the configuration, monitors definitions, and schedules executions. The data is encrypted through the [ActiveGate token](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/activegate-security "Secure ActiveGates with dedicated tokens.").
2. **Synthetic engine to ActiveGate**

   The Synthetic engine requests the configuration, and monitors definitions and executions from clusters via ActiveGate. The data is encrypted through the `synthetic token`, which is created on the ActiveGate start and stored in the `synthetic.token` file within your `config` foler. This token file is shared between ActiveGate and the Synthetic engine.
3. **Synthetic engine to beacon forwarder**

   The Synthetic engine sends results of the executions. The data is encrypted through the `synthetic monitors` token. The Dynatrace Cluster generates this token on a tenant level, and it rotates every 24 hours. Once a day, tokens that are older than 48 hours get deleted. The token is provided to the engine with execution details, and the communication is secured with the [ActiveGate token](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/activegate-security "Secure ActiveGates with dedicated tokens.").
4. **Beacon forwarder to Dynatrace cluster**

   The beacon forwarder forwards results sent by the engine to the cluster. The data is encrypted through the [ActiveGate token](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/activegate-security "Secure ActiveGates with dedicated tokens.").

5. **Dynatrace Cluster to Synthetic public infrastructure**

   The cluster provides monitors definitions, maintenance windows details, and tenant stateâincluding license state. The data is encrypted through the `synthetic monitors` token. The Dynatrace Cluster generates this token on a tenant level, and it rotates every 24 hours. Once a day, tokens that are older than 48 hours get deleted. The token is provided to the engine with execution details, and the communication is secured with the [ActiveGate token](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/activegate-security "Secure ActiveGates with dedicated tokens.").
6. **Synthetic engine to public infrastructure**

   The Synthetic engine requests configuration, monitors definitions and executions from the public infrastructure, and delivers diagnostic data. The data is secured on the network level.
7. **Synthetic engine to beacon forwarder**

   The Synthetic engine sends results of the executions. The data is encrypted through the `synthetic monitors` token. The Dynatrace Cluster generates this token on a tenant level, and it rotates every 24 hours. Once a day, tokens that are older than 48 hours get deleted. The token is provided to the engine with execution details, and the communication is secured with the [ActiveGate token](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/activegate-security "Secure ActiveGates with dedicated tokens.").

# External vault integration

# External vault integration

* How-to guide
* 22-min read
* Updated on Jan 17, 2024

Synthetic Monitoring [username-password](/docs/manage/credential-vault#uid-password "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.") and [token](/docs/manage/credential-vault#token "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.") credentials in the Dynatrace [credential vault](/docs/manage/credential-vault "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.") can be synchronized with an external vaultâ[Azure Key Vault](#azure-key-vault), [HashiCorp Vault](#hashicorp), or [CyberArk Vault](#cyberark) (username-password credentials only). Synchronized credentials contain the keys of external key-value pairs that hold the required values.

When you set up synchronized credentials in the credential vault, Dynatrace automatically creates [HTTP monitors](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/create-an-http-monitor-classic "Learn how to set up an HTTP monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.") specifically for the purpose of synchronization. You can also use the `api.saveCredential()` or `api.saveToken()` methods in [pre-and post-execution scripts](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/pre-and-post-scripting-for-http-monitors-classic "Learn how to apply pre and post scripts to your requests") to create your own synchronization monitors.

Autocreated synchronization monitors are named with the credential ID of the synchronized credential and are executed hourly by default from the Amazon US East (N. Virginia) [public Synthetic location](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/public-synthetic-locations "Learn about all currently available public Synthetic Monitoring locations."). Note that the request and response bodies and headers of synchronization monitors are automatically hidden from execution details (**Analyze execution details**).

Other synthetic monitors can call and use these synchronized credentials for testing API endpoints and websites. The monitors that call these credentials use the synchronized values obtained from the external vaults. Synchronization frequency determines how often these credentials are rotated within the synthetic monitors that call them.

Synchronization process reads the credentials from external vault and saves a copy within the Dynatrace vault.

## Azure Key Vault

Username-password or token credentials for use in synthetic monitors can be synchronized with Azure Key Vault key-value pairs containing the username, password, or token value.

### Prerequisites

Before setting up credentials synchronized with Azure Key Vault, you need to define the required **client (application) ID** and **client secret** as [token credentials](/docs/manage/credential-vault#token "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.") stored in the Dynatrace [credential vault](/docs/manage/credential-vault "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault."). We recommend naming such prerequisite tokens so that they're easily identifiable as companion credentials for synchronization. If your vault doesn't contain any tokens that you have access to, you'll see a warning.

### Set up synchronized credentials

1. In the credential vault, create a **User and password** or **Token** credential. You can also overwrite an existing credential.
2. For **Credential scope**, select **Synthetic**.
3. Turn on **Synchronization with external vault**.
4. Select **Azure Key Vault** (default) as the **Credential source**.
5. We recommend editing the default **Credential name** to easily identify your new credential.
6. Enter the URL to access the vault (**Vault URL**) and the **Tenant (directory) ID**.
7. Select the [companion tokens](#azure-prereqs) created earlier for the **Client (application) ID** and **Client secret**.
8. Enter the name of the Azure Key Vault key.

   Username-password credentials

   Token credentials

   * In **Secret name for username**, enter the name of the Azure Key Vault key mapped to the username value; do not enter an actual username.
   * In **Secret name for password**, enter the name of the Azure Key Vault key mapped to the password value; do not enter an actual password.

   * In **Secret name for token**, enter the name of the Azure Key Vault key mapped to the token value; do not enter an actual token value.
9. Select a **Location for synchronization**âyou can select any public or private Synthetic location for [synchronization monitor](#azure-monitor) execution. You can search for a location by entering the location name in the field.
10. Optional Provide a **Description** for the credential.
11. Credentials are set to **Owner access only** by default. (Read more about [credential ownership](/docs/manage/credential-vault#owner-shared-public "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.").)
12. **Save** your credential.

See also [Best practices](#best-practices) and what happens when you [edit or delete synchronized and companion credentials](#edit-delete-credential).

### Azure Key Vault synchronization monitors

When you have [set up your synchronized username-password or token credential](#azure-set-up), Dynatrace automatically creates and executes an [HTTP monitor](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/create-an-http-monitor-classic "Learn how to set up an HTTP monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.") that synchronizes the credential with Azure Key Vault. This monitor is automatically associated with the synchronized username-password or token credential.

See also [Best practices](#best-practices) and what happens when you [edit or delete synchronization credentials](#edit-delete-credential).

Username-password credentials

Token credentials

The synchronization monitor contains three requests. Azure Key Vault requires splitting the retrieval of the username and password into two separate requests.

1. The first request (POST) fetches an access token.
   Request configuration details

   * The request URL references the tenant ID as an attribute of the [synchronized credential](#azure-set-up) defined above; the tenant ID is not displayed.

     ![Azure KV request 1 URL](https://dt-cdn.net/images/cvazurerequest1url-1446-eed3251a4d.png)
   * The client ID and client secret, referenced as attributes of the synchronized credential, are passed as key-value pairs in the [request body](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/configure-http-monitors-classic#request-body "Learn about configuring HTTP monitors."); the client ID and client secret are not displayed.

     ![Azure KV request 1 request body](https://dt-cdn.net/images/cvazurerequest1requestbody-984-7631f538d2.png)

## HashiCorp Vault

[Username-password or token credentials](#hashicorp-set-up) for use in synthetic monitors can be synchronized with HashiCorp Vault key-value pairs containing the username, password, or token value. You can use either **[AppRole-based](#app-role) or [certificate authentication](#certificate)**.

### Prerequisites

* Before using [AppRole-based authentication](#app-role), you need to define the required **secret ID** as a [token credential](/docs/manage/credential-vault#token "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.") stored in the Dynatrace [credential vault](/docs/manage/credential-vault "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault."); do not reuse other tokens as the secret ID. If your vault doesn't contain any tokens you have access to, you'll see a warning.
* Before using [certificate authentication](#certificate), you need to store the required **TLS [certificate](/docs/manage/credential-vault#certificate "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.")** in the Dynatrace [credential vault](/docs/manage/credential-vault "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault."). If your vault doesn't contain any certificates you have access to, you'll see a warning.

We recommend naming such prerequisite tokens and certificates so that they're easily identifiable as companion credentials for synchronization.

### Set up synchronized credentials

1. In the credential vault, create a **User and password** or **Token** credential. You can also overwrite an existing credential.
2. For **Credential scope**, select **Synthetic**.
3. Turn on **Synchronization with external vault**.
4. Select **HashiCorp Vault** as the **Credential source**.
5. We recommend editing the default **Credential name** to easily identify your new credential.
6. Enter the URL to access the vault (**Vault URL**) and the **Path to credentials** (folders must be separated by a forward slash).

   The HashiCorp **Vault URL** for certificate authentication might be different from that used for AppRole-based authentication.
7. Enter the name of the HashiCorp Vault key.

   Username-password credentials

   Token credentials

   * In **Secret name for username**, enter the name of the HashiCorp Vault key mapped to the username value; do not enter an actual username.
   * In **Secret name for password**, enter the name of the HashiCorp Vault key mapped to the password value; do not enter an actual password.

   * In **Secret name for token**, enter the name of the HashiCorp Vault key mapped to the token value; do not enter an actual token value.
8. Perform steps related to **Authentication method**.

   AppRole

   Certificate

   1. Select **AppRole** for the **Authentication method**.
   2. Enter the string provided by HashiCorp in **Role ID**.
   3. Select the [companion token](#hashicorp-prereqs) created earlier for the **Secret ID**.
   4. Enter the **Vault namespace**.

   ![Set up HashiCorp AppRole synchronization - token](https://dt-cdn.net/images/cv-hashicorp-approle-token-1113-2263da2bbc.webp)

   5. Select **Certificate** for the **Authentication method**.
   6. For **Certificate**, select the [companion TLS certificate](#hashicorp-prereqs) created earlier.

   ![Set up HashiCorp certificate synchronization - UID](https://dt-cdn.net/images/cv-hashicorp-certificate-uid-1113-8b177811b5.webp)
9. Select a **Location for synchronization**âyou can select any public or private Synthetic location for synchronization monitor execution. You can search for a location by entering the location name in the field.
10. Optional Provide a **Description**.
11. Credentials are set to **Owner access only** by default. (Read more about [credential ownership](/docs/manage/credential-vault#owner-shared-public "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.").)
12. **Save** your credential.

See also [Best practices](#best-practices) and what happens when you [edit or delete synchronized and companion credentials](#edit-delete-credential).

When you have set up your synchronized credential, Dynatrace automatically creates and executes an [HTTP monitor](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/create-an-http-monitor-classic "Learn how to set up an HTTP monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.") that synchronizes the credential with HashiCorp Vault.

### HashiCorp Vault AppRole synchronization monitors

The autocreated HTTP monitor contains two requests and is automatically associated with the [synchronized credential](#hashicorp-set-up) defined above.

Username-password credentials

Token credentials

1. The first request (POST) fetches a client token.
   Request configuration details

   * The request URL references the vault URL as an attribute of the [synchronized credential](#hashicorp-set-up); the vault URL is not displayed. The request URL also contains the authentication method `approle`.

## CyberArk Vault

Username-password credentials for use in synthetic monitors can be synchronized with CyberArk Vault key-value pairs containing the username or password. You can use either [username and password](#cyberark-monitor-uid-authentication) or [host-based authentication](#cyberark-monitor-allowed-machines) to CyberArk Vault. Host-based authentication allows you to predefine hosts (**Allowed Machines**) in CyberArk Vault that are allowed to access credentials. These hosts are the [public or private Synthetic locations you select](#cyberark-set-up) for synchronization monitor execution and are defined by hostname or IP address. Host-based authentication enables synchronization monitors to bypass fetching an access token from CyberArk Vault.

### Prerequisites

* Before using [username and password authentication](#cyberark-monitor-uid-authentication), you need to define authentication credentials for CyberArk Vaultâa [username-password pair](/docs/manage/credential-vault#uid-password "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.") and, optionally, a [certificate credential](/docs/manage/credential-vault#certificate "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.") stored in the Dynatrace [credential vault](/docs/manage/credential-vault "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault."). We recommend naming such prerequisite credentials so that they're easily identifiable as companion credentials for synchronization.
* Before using [host-based authentication](#cyberark-monitor-allowed-machines), you need to define **Allowed Machines** by hostname or IP address in CyberArk Vault Application Details. These are the hosts that are allowed to access the synchronized credentials in CyberArk Vault and are the public or private Synthetic locations you select for synchronization monitor execution. Note that when defining allowed machines in CyberArk Vault, the application ID must be the same as provided when [you set up a synchronized credential in Dynatrace](#cyberak-set-up). Optionally, you can also define a [certificate credential](/docs/manage/credential-vault#certificate "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.") stored in the Dynatrace [credential vault](/docs/manage/credential-vault "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.") for authentication to CyberArk Vault. If your vault doesn't contain any certificates you have access to, you'll see a warning.

We recommend naming any prerequisite credentials so that they're easily identifiable as companion credentials for synchronization.

### Set up synchronized credentials

1. In the credential vault, create a **User and password** credential. You can also overwrite an existing credential.
2. For **Credential scope**, select **Synthetic**.
3. Turn on **Synchronization with external vault**.
4. Select **CyberArk Vault** as the **Credential source**.
5. We recommend editing the default **Credential name** to easily identify your new credential.
6. Enter the **Central Credential Provider URL** (HTTPS) to access the vault.
7. Perform steps related to **Authentication method**.

   Username and password

   Allowed machines

   1. Select **Username and password** for the **Authentication method**.
   2. Select the [companion username-password](#cyberark-prereqs) created earlier for CyberArk authentication from the **Username and password for Central Credential Provider** list.

   ![Set up CyberArk synchronization - UID](https://dt-cdn.net/images/cyberark-credential-vault-uid-1145-62675d95c7.webp)

   1. Select **Allowed machines (location)** for the **Authentication method**.

      You should already have registered the hostname or IP address of your selected **Location for synchronization** in the CyberArk Allowed Machines listâsee [Prerequisites](#cyberark-prereqs) above.

   ![Set up CyberArk synchronization - allowed machines](https://dt-cdn.net/images/cyberark-credential-vault-allowed-machines-1154-a9d5d09098.webp)
8. Recommended Select a **Certificate used for authentication to CyberArk application** from the list provided.
9. Enter additional fields for identifying the CyberArk Vault key-value pair.

   * **Application ID**âThis must be the same as the application ID when defining allowed machines in CyberArk Vaultâsee [Prerequisites](#cyberark-prereqs) above.
   * **Safe name**
   * **Account name**âThe name of the object that stores the username and password to retrieve and synchronize with the Dynatrace credential vault; this is not the name of the account logged into CyberArk Central Credential Provider.
   * **Folder name** OptionalâThe name of the folder where the credentials are stored in CyberArk Vault; the default folder name is `Root`.
10. Select a **Location for synchronization**âyou can select any public or private Synthetic location for synchronization monitor execution. You can search for a location by entering the location name in the field.
11. Optional Provide a **Description** for the credential.
12. Credentials are set to **Owner access only** by default. (Read more about [credential ownership](/docs/manage/credential-vault#owner-shared-public "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.").)
13. **Save** your credential.

See also [Best practices](#best-practices) and what happens when you [edit or delete synchronized and companion credentials](#edit-delete-credential).

When you have set up your synchronized credential, Dynatrace automatically creates and executes an [HTTP monitor](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/create-an-http-monitor-classic "Learn how to set up an HTTP monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.") that synchronizes the credential with CyberArk Vault.

### CyberArk Vault synchronization monitors (username-password authentication)

The autocreated HTTP monitor contains two requests and is automatically associated with the [synchronized credential](#cyberark-set-up) defined above.

1. The first request (POST) fetches an access token.
   Request configuration details

   * The request URL references the **Central Credential Provider URL** as an attribute of the [synchronized credential](#cyberark-set-up) defined above; the central credential provider URL is not displayed.

     ![CyberArk Vault request 1 URL](https://dt-cdn.net/images/cv-cyberark-request1-url-1445-f352bc0566.png)
   * The [request body](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/configure-http-monitors-classic#request-body "Learn about configuring HTTP monitors.") references the username-password credential selected for CyberArk Vault authentication (**Username and password for Central Credential Provider**); the authentication username and password are not displayed.

     ![CyberArk Vault request 1 request body](https://dt-cdn.net/images/cv-cyberark-request1-request-body-1409-efb85f9433.png)
   * Additionally, the first request contains any authentication certificate specified in **Certificate used for authentication to CyberArk**.

     ![CyberArk Vault request 1 certificate](https://dt-cdn.net/images/cv-cyberark-request1-certificate-962-8b7934f165.png)
   * A token is returned in the response body. A [post-execution script](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/pre-and-post-scripting-for-http-monitors-classic "Learn how to apply pre and post scripts to your requests") saves the token in a [global variable](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/pre-and-post-scripting-for-http-monitors-classic#variables "Learn how to apply pre and post scripts to your requests").

     ![CyberArk Vault request 1 post script](https://dt-cdn.net/images/cv-cyberark-request1-post-script-962-04c94bf083.png)
2. The second request (GET) fetches the username and password values from CyberArk Vault. It also uses `api.saveCredential()` in a post-execution script to write the fetched values to the [synchronized username-password credential](#cyberark-set-up) defined above.
   Request configuration details

   * The request URL references the **Central Credential Provider URL** as an attribute of the synchronized credential; the central credential provider URL is not displayed. The request URL also references (but doesn't display) the **Application ID**, **Safe name**, **Account name**, and **Folder name**.

     ![CyberArk Vault request 2 URL](https://dt-cdn.net/images/cv-cyberark-request2-url-1879-7911c0b652.png)
   * The second request also contains any authentication certificate and the access token retrieved in the first request in the [Authorization header](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/configure-http-monitors-classic#headers "Learn about configuring HTTP monitors.").

     ![CyberArk Vault request 2 token and certificate](https://dt-cdn.net/images/cv-cyberark-request2-certificate-auth-header-1269-b10aa9737b.png)
   * The username and password values are returned in the response body. A [post-execution script](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/pre-and-post-scripting-for-http-monitors-classic "Learn how to apply pre and post scripts to your requests") saves the values in [global variables](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/pre-and-post-scripting-for-http-monitors-classic#variables "Learn how to apply pre and post scripts to your requests"). It also uses `api.saveCredential()` to write the retrieved values to the synchronized username-password credential.

     ![CyberArk Vault request 2 post script](https://dt-cdn.net/images/cv-cyberark-request2-post-script-999-5b4607154b.png)

### CyberArk Vault synchronization monitors (host-based authentication)

Because the autocreated HTTP monitor can bypass fetching an access token, it contains a single GET request to fetch the username and password values from CyberArk Vault. It also uses `api.saveCredential()` in a post-execution script to write the fetched values to the [synchronized username-password credential](#cyberark-set-up) defined above. The synchronization monitor is automatically associated with the synchronized credential.

Request configuration details

* The request URL references the **Central Credential Provider URL** as an attribute of the synchronized credential; the central credential provider URL is not displayed. The request URL also references (but doesn't display) the **Application ID**, **Safe name**, **Account name**, and **Folder name**.

![CyberArk Vault allowed machines request URL](https://dt-cdn.net/images/cv-cyberark-allowed-machines-url-1881-1ea05be669.jpg)

* The request also contains any authentication certificate specified during credential setup.

![CyberArk Vault allowed machines authentication certificate](https://dt-cdn.net/images/cv-cyberark-allowed-machines-certificate-1415-568a21181f.jpg)

* The username and password values are returned in the response body. A [post-execution script](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/pre-and-post-scripting-for-http-monitors-classic "Learn how to apply pre and post scripts to your requests") saves the values in [global variables](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/pre-and-post-scripting-for-http-monitors-classic#variables "Learn how to apply pre and post scripts to your requests"). It also uses `api.saveCredential()` to write the retrieved values to the synchronized username-password credential.

![CyberArk Vault allowed machines post script](https://dt-cdn.net/images/cv-cyberark-allowed-machines-post-script-1415-5e3ea56704.jpg)

## Best practices and caveats

If creating a synchronization monitor manually, be sure to select **Do not store and display request and response bodies and header values in execution details** in any requests that fetch client tokens or credential values from external vaults. Failing to do so will expose the sensitive information when you **Analyze execution details** in [HTTP monitor details](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/synthetic-details-for-http-monitors-classic "Learn about the Synthetic details page for HTTP monitors.").

* Automatically created synchronization monitors may be edited. To edit an autocreated synchronization monitor, you must have [access to the credentials](/docs/manage/credential-vault#owner-shared-public "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.") referenced in the monitor. You might need to make edits if the external vault vendor makes changes. For example, you might need to edit request URLs if Microsoft changes the API version for fetching client tokens from Azure Key Vault.

  + In general, however, we recommend that you limit your changes to execution frequency or locations.
  + When changing location, be careful not to pick [private Synthetic locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring.") that don't have external network access.
  + When changing location to a private Synthetic location, ensure that the proxy configuration isn't blocking access to required resources.
* We recommend editing the default names of synchronized credentials, companion credentials (for example, TLS certificates for HashiCorp Vault), and synchronization monitors for easy identification.
* We do not recommend reusing companion credentials (for example, for the HashiCorp secret ID token) required for synchronization monitors in other synthetic monitors for testing purposes.

### Edit or delete synchronized and companion credentials

* Once created, synchronized credentials are no longer editable by anyone; they can only be [overwritten](/docs/manage/credential-vault#overwrite-credential "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault."). In order to overwrite a synchronized credential, you need to provide new synchronization details; do not provide actual username, password, or token values.

  + When you overwrite a synchronized credential, Dynatrace-created synchronization monitors are automatically updated.
* Be sure to maintain the same [ownership](/docs/manage/credential-vault#owner-shared-public "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.") for all credentials within a synchronization monitor (that is, the synchronized credential and companion credentials).
* You cannot delete companion credentials referenced by a synchronization monitor unless you disable or delete the synchronization monitor.
* If you delete a synchronized credential, its autocreated synchronization monitor is deleted as well.

  + If there's more than one synchronization monitor, you need to delete or disable such monitors before you can delete a synchronized credential.
  + Any synthetic monitor that uses the (deleted) synchronized credential for testing is disabled.

# On-demand synthetic monitor executions for CI/CD

# On-demand synthetic monitor executions for CI/CD

* Explanation
* 17-min read
* Updated on Jul 03, 2024

ActiveGate version 1.233+

In addition to scheduling synthetic monitor executions at regular intervals (in **Frequency and locations** settings), you can also trigger on-demand executions for [browser](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/configure-browser-monitors "Learn about configuring browser monitors and clickpaths.") as well as [HTTP](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/configure-http-monitors-classic "Learn about configuring HTTP monitors.") monitors. You can even trigger on-demand executions of [autocreated HTTP monitors for credential synchronization](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/external-vault-integration "Synchronize Synthetic Monitoring credentials with external vaults."). In the [Dynatrace web UI](#ui), select **On-demand execution** at the top of a monitor's details page.

![Trigger on-demand executions](https://dt-cdn.net/images/on-demand-execution-ui-2174-b5b18ea2b7.png)

You can also use the powerful [**Synthetic - On-demand monitor executions** API](#api) to trigger executions of multiple monitors and retrieve the results. On-demand execution requests take precedence over your scheduled executions and are sent to the top of the request queue.

You can trigger on-demand executions from **any** assigned or unassigned location [via the web UI](#ui) or [the API](#api).

During synthetic monitor creation and in edit mode, you can also set up a monitor to be executed on demand onlyâselect the **On demand only** frequency.

![On-demand frequency](https://dt-cdn.net/images/frequencyondemandonly-617-ae2bdb37f6.jpg)

On-demand executions, with their powerful features, are a valuable tool in your CI/CD strategy:

* Monitors can be executed on demand from any location, public or private.
* On-demand execution results may be included or excluded from overall monitor results.
* Executions may be included or excluded from problem detection.
* Executions can be triggered via the web UI or API.

These executions can validate that a new deployment of your software is successful and can be integrated with build tools like Jenkins or [Keptnï»¿](https://v1.keptn.sh/docs).

On-demand executions are also very valuable as quick monitor tests, for example, to test a monitor after developing a complex script. Likewise, such executions can verify that a fix for a Dynatrace-detected problem was effective, for example, if you added host memory or reverted to an older application version.

With their ability to be included or excluded from overall monitor results and problem detection, on-demand executions offer many more options than [local playback of browser clickpaths](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/record-a-browser-clickpath#playback "Learn how to record a browser clickpath to monitor the availability and performance of your application.").

## UI-based on-demand executions

The **On-demand execution** button on synthetic monitor details pages allows you to trigger executions for the selected monitor from all or a selected location. It also displays a list of all on-demand executions for the monitor over the preceding six hours, triggered by any user via the web UI or [API](#api).

![On-demand execution page](https://dt-cdn.net/images/on-demand-executions-http-monitor-2207-0d9244213b.png)

### Trigger an execution

Any user with the **View environment** permission at the environment or management-zone level can trigger an execution via the UI.

Even if you [disable scheduled synthetic monitor execution during maintenance windows](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/notifications-and-alerting/maintenance-windows/define-maintenance-window#disable-synthetic "Create maintenance windows and define their scope."), you can still execute monitors on demand.

1. Select **On-demand execution** at the top of the monitor's details page.
2. You are directed to the **On-demand execution** page. Select **All assigned locations** or any assigned or unassigned public or private location.
3. Select a **Processing mode**ânote that this applies to all executions if you select all locations.

   * **Standard** (default)âthe executions contribute to problem detection and availability and performance statistics. For browser monitors, you can view data points on the [**Multidimensional analysis** page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/multidimensional-analysis-for-browser-monitors "Learn how to analyze browser-monitor data points."). For HTTP monitors, you can access execution results when you [**Analyze execution details**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/synthetic-details-for-http-monitors-classic "Learn about the Synthetic details page for HTTP monitors.").
   * **Disable problem detection**âthe executions contribute to availability and performance statistics but not to problem detection. For browser monitors, data points appear on the **Multidimensional analysis** page; for HTTP monitors, you can view execution results when you **Analyze execution details**.
   * **Execution details only**âthe executions do not contribute to availability and performance statistics or to problem detection. For HTTP monitors, you can still access results when you **Analyze execution details**; for browser monitors, these data points appear on the **Multidimensional analysis** page.

   Note that for all processing modes, executions are visible in the list of on-demand executions in the web UI and retrieved via the [on-demand executions API](#api). Summary and detailed execution information is available for six hours via the API.
4. **Fail on performance threshold violation**âby default, on-demand executions fail when they violate a performance threshold, given that their main purpose is to validate new software versions in your CI/CD pipeline. However, you can disable this setting so that on-demand executions behave like regularly scheduled executions (that is, performance threshold violations do not cause monitors to fail).
5. HTTP monitors only **Fail on missing or expiring SSL certificate**âfail the monitor if one or more of its requests encounters an expired, missing, or expiring SSL certificate.

   This setting only works if **SSL expiration date verification** has already been enabled for an HTTP request in [monitor settings](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/configure-http-monitors-classic "Learn about configuring HTTP monitors."); it uses the request-level setting to check for SSL certificate validity within the specified number of days.

   If your monitor has multiple requests with different settings for SSL certificate validity, **Fail on missing or expiring SSL certificate** checks and honors each setting.
6. Browser monitors only **Take screenshot on successful execution**âcapture screenshots upon success from public or private locations; this setting is disabled by default. When you enable this setting, screenshots upon success are captured even if the monitor exceeds a performance threshold. If you trigger executions from all locations, screenshots upon success are captured from the first location. You can also capture screenshots upon success for executions triggered via the API.

   Note that screenshots are automatically captured upon failure.
7. Select **Trigger now**âyou see a summary dialog listing the execution locations; the execution list displays new entries for the triggered executions. The **Execution stage** initially is `Triggered`.

   Any change you make to monitor script (configuration) is immediately available for on-demand executions on public or private locations.

   Note that executions might not all begin at the same time from different locationsâexecutions might take longer to begin from public locations than from private locations. See additional information on [throttling](#throttling) below.

   ![Triggered execution](https://dt-cdn.net/images/on-demand-exec-triggered-2185-f3ccf8cf28.png)

### Throttling and limits

* There is a mandatory gap per user of 60 seconds between consecutive on-demand executions of a monitor from the same location (whether triggered via the web UI or API).

  Examples of throttling

  All these examples assume execution from the same location.

  + User A triggers a monitor via API within 60 seconds of triggering the same monitor via UIâthrottled.
  + User B triggers a monitor via API within 60 seconds of user A triggering the same monitor via UIâno throttling.
  + User B triggers a monitor via UI within 60 seconds of user A triggering the same monitor via UIâno throttling.
  + User B triggers a monitor via API within 60 seconds of user A triggering the same monitor via APIâno throttling.

* When triggering multiple on-demand executions via the [API](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/on-demand-executions#api "Execute synthetic monitors on demand from public or private locations"), there is a limit of 100 executions per batch.
* There's also a limit of 5000 on-demand executions per minute for a Dynatrace environment.
* You can define up to 64 key-value pairs of [metadata per batch](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/on-demand-executions#api "Execute synthetic monitors on demand from public or private locations"), where keys and values can each be up to 1024 characters.
* When specifying [repeated on-demand executions per location](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/on-demand-executions#api "Execute synthetic monitors on demand from public or private locations"), the maximum execution count is 10.

### Failure to be triggered

On-demand executions might not be successfully triggered for various reasons, for example, when a monitor is disabled, a location is down, or when throttling is in effect for a monitor on a given location.

There are several additional reasons that on-demand executions might not be successfully triggered via the [API](#api): monitor deletion, incorrect specification of monitor or location IDs, incorrect specification of related service or application IDs, location deletion, problems with the public Synthetic infrastructure, or problems with your Dynatrace monitoring environment.

If an execution can't be successfully triggered via the UI, the reasons are shown in the **Triggering status summary** after you select **Trigger now**. The **Execution stage** in the execution list is `Not triggered`. Details of executions not triggered via the [API](#api) are returned in the `triggeringProblemsCount` and `triggeringProblemsDetails` response parameters for the POST request.

![Failure to be triggered](https://dt-cdn.net/images/on-demand-exec-not-triggered-2190-97500e2d2a.png)

Executions that can't be triggered are different from executions that are triggered but can't be executedâsee the [API](#api) section below for information.

### List of executions

The list of executions shows all on-demand executions (triggered by any user via the web UI or API) for a given monitor within the last six hours.

![On-demand execution list](https://dt-cdn.net/images/on-demand-exec-list-2179-8c66facb90.png)

* The **Execution ID** is a unique ID assigned to each execution; if you trigger executions from all locations, each location's execution has a different ID.
* The **Triggered** column shows the start time of the execution in the logged-in user's time zone.
* **Source** shows whether the execution was triggered via the web `UI` or the `API`.
* The **User** column shows the Dynatrace user ID of the user who triggered the execution.
* The **Location** column shows the name of the public or private location from which the monitor was executed.
* **Execution stage** identifies the different stages of the on-demand execution. The initial value is `Triggered` (or `Not triggered`). When execution is complete, the value changes to `Executed`. Basic results such as duration and HTTP status code are available at this stage. The progress spinner continues to be displayed at the `Executed` stage until detailed results are available and the value changes to `Data retrieved`. If multiple sequential executions are triggered per location, the first execution is marked `Triggered`; the remaining executions are marked `Waiting`.

* The **Result** column displays whether the execution was a `Success` or `Failure` (with an accompanying **Failure reason**).
* You can **Rerun** ![Refresh](https://dt-cdn.net/images/refresh-turquoise-500-64f72fec6c.svg "Refresh") an execution with the exact configuration defined, for example, with metadata defined via the API. Besides metadata, other execution parameters replicated are the [processing mode](#trigger-ui), failure for violating a performance threshold, failure due to an SSL certificate issue, and screenshot capture upon success.
* Select the expand button ![Expand row](https://dt-cdn.net/images/expand-row-icon-9c4950fc2e.svg "Expand row") in the **Details** column to view execution duration, batch metadata like key-value pairs (available via [API](#api) only), and a link to results.

### Results

When the **Execution stage** in the [list of executions](#list) changes to `Data retrieved`, you can follow the **execution details** link to view detailed results for the browser or HTTP monitor that was executed.

For browser monitors, you're directed to the **Multidimensional analysis** page with the data point selected in the scatter plot. On-demand executions are identifiable by shape in the [scatter plot](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/multidimensional-analysis-for-browser-monitors#scatter-plot "Learn how to analyze browser-monitor data points.") as well as by an annotation in the list of [data points](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/multidimensional-analysis-for-browser-monitors#data-points "Learn how to analyze browser-monitor data points.").

![Scatter plot](https://dt-cdn.net/images/scatterplotondemandexecution-2164-393f41dda4.jpg)

Screenshot collection for on-demand browser monitor executions is the same as for [scheduled executions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/synthetic-details-for-browser-monitors#screenshots "Analyze browser monitor and clickpath results on the Synthetic details page."). However, you can enable screenshot collection upon success [via the UI](#trigger-ui) as well as POST requests [via API](#api).

For HTTP monitors, you're directed to the **On-demand execution** tab of the **Analyze execution details** page. You can also access this tab by selecting **Analyze execution details** from the [HTTP monitor details page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/synthetic-details-for-http-monitors-classic "Learn about the Synthetic details page for HTTP monitors."). Select an on-demand **Execution** from the dropdown list to view its details.

![On-demand executions tab](https://dt-cdn.net/images/analyze-last-execution-filters2-1600-0085726604.png)

The **On-demand execution** tab is overwritten with each on-demand execution. If the on-demand executions are in **Standard** or **Disable problem detection** modes, details are also written to the last failed/successful execution tabs. Note that in these modes, if you fail a monitor for violating a performance threshold, the execution appears in the tabs for successful and on-demand executions.

## API: Synthetic - On-demand monitor executions

Check the section on [throttling](#throttling) above for on-demand execution limits via the web UI and API.

For more information, check documentation on the [Synthetic monitor executions API v2](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/synthetic-v2/synthetic-monitor-execution "View the results of Synthetic monitor executions via the Synthetic v2 API."). You can [trigger a batch execution](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/synthetic-v2/synthetic-monitor-execution/post-batch-execution "Trigger a batch execution of synthetic monitors via the Dynatrace API."), [list on-demand executions](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/synthetic-v2/synthetic-monitor-execution/get-all-executions "List all on-demand executions of synthetic monitors via the Dynatrace API."), check [basic](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/synthetic-v2/synthetic-monitor-execution/get-execution-basic "View basic information about an on-demand execution of a synthetic monitor via the Dynatrace API.") as well as [detailed results](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/synthetic-v2/synthetic-monitor-execution/get-execution-full "View full information about an on-demand execution of a synthetic monitor via the Dynatrace API.") of a single execution, and check [batch execution results](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/synthetic-v2/synthetic-monitor-execution/get-batch-summary "View the summary of a batch execution of synthetic monitors via the Dynatrace API.").

API-based on-demand executions offer greater flexibility and scalability than the UI. The **Synthetic - On-demand monitor executions** API offers:

* The ability to execute multiple monitors on demand (**batch execution**) by specifying monitor IDs, and, optionally, location IDs. If you don't specify locations, a monitor is executed from all assigned locations. This ability is only available via API.
* The ability to execute monitors from **any location**. In the POST request for triggering on-demand executions, each specified monitor is executed from the specified locations (or all assigned locations if none are specified).
* ActiveGate version 1.259+ The ability to specify an **execution count for repeated executions per location**, which is helpful for quality gates and load tests. This ability is only available via API. The `executionCount` parameter allows you to specify the number of executions per location for each monitor; the maximum value is 10; if there is no value, the monitor is executed once per location. Executions can be triggered sequentially (`repeatMode` is `SEQUENTIAL`) or in parallel (`repeatMode` is `PARALLEL`). The default mode is sequential.

  In sequential mode, each execution automatically references the following execution, if any, with the `nextExecutionId` parameter. When you trigger multiple sequential executions on a location, the first execution is in the `Triggered` stage while the others are marked `Waiting`. Executions on each location are independent of each other.

  + If a sequential execution times out on a location, any following executions on that location are not triggered.
  + Note that execution IDs in `nextExecutionId` are sequential for public locations and randomly generated for private locations.
  + Monitor script or credential changes after a batch of sequential executions has been triggered do not affect any remaining executions. So if another user changes a script you are executing sequentially, the script changes are not reflected in any remaining executions.
* ActiveGate version 1.259+ The ability to **partially override the monitor script** and provide custom parameter values specifically for on-demand execution, which simplifies the reconfiguration and testing of synthetic monitors. This ability is only available via API. The `customizedScript` parameter allows you to list `requests` (HTTP monitors) or `events` (browser monitors) with customizations per request or event. For HTTP monitors, you see which parameters had custom values when you [**Analyze execution details**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/synthetic-details-for-http-monitors-classic#analyze-last-execution "Learn about the Synthetic details page for HTTP monitors.").

  The following parameters can be customized for HTTP monitors

  + `url`
  + `requestBody`
  + `validation`
  + `preProcessingScript`
  + `postProcessingScript`
  + `requestTimeout`
  + `authentication`
  + `configuration`

    - `requestHeaders`
    - `acceptAnyCertificate`
    - `followRedirects`

  The following event types can be customized for browser monitors

  + Navigate
  + Click
  + JavaScript
  + Keystroke
  + Tap
  + Select option
  + Cookie

  You can optionally specify a `sequenceId` for the order of the request or event in the monitor script. For example, use `"sequenceId": "3"` to specify changes to the third event in a browser monitor. If you don't specify a `sequenceId`, the modifications apply to the first request or event that hasn't been referenced by a sequence ID in the API request. See examples below.

  + Any such script changes are for the purpose of on-demand execution only and do not persist thereafter.
  + You cannot change or reorder the number of requests or events.
  + You cannot change the **Name** of requests or events (`description` in script mode).
  + You cannot change the request type (for example, GET) or event type (for example, Navigate).
  + You cannot add a pre- or post-processing script to an HTTP monitor that has neither.

  Example: HTTP monitor with custom URL for a single request

  As no sequence ID is specified, the URL override in this example applies to the first HTTP request.

  ```
  {



  "monitors": [



  {



  "monitorId": "HTTP_CHECK-C608F75BF82E5B22",



  "customizedScript": {



  "requests": [



  {



  "url": "https://www.yourdomain.com"



  }



  ]



  }



  }



  ]



  }
  ```

  Example: HTTP monitor with overrides for two requests

  As no sequence ID is specified, the URL override and pre-execution script with the `api.fail()` method apply to the first HTTP request. Note that you can only override the pre- or post-execution script for a monitor that already has one such script defined. For the third request where the sequence ID has been specified, a validation rule has been added.

  ```
  {



  "monitors": [



  {



  "monitorId": "HTTP_CHECK-6349B98E1CD87352",



  "customizedScript": {



  "requests": [



  {



  "url": "https://www.somepage.org",



  "preProcessingScript": "if (response.getResponseBody().includes(\"error\")) {api.fail(\"HTTP failing monitor.\");}"



  },



  {



  "sequenceId": "3",



  "validation": {



  "rules": [



  {



  "value": "=201",



  "passIfFound": "true"



  }



  ]



  }



  }



  ]



  }



  }



  ]



  }
  ```

  Example: Browser monitor with custom URL for Navigate event

  As no sequence ID is specified, the URL override in this example applies to the first Navigate event.

  ```
  {



  "takeScreenshotsOnSuccess": true,



  "monitors": [



  {



  "monitorId": "SYNTHETIC_TEST-114F1C18CF07CD1D",



  "customizedScript": {



  "events": [



  {



  "type": "navigate",



  "url": "www.yourdomain.com"



  }



  ]



  }



  }



  ]



  }
  ```
* The ability to execute a group of monitors on demand by specifying common **tags and/or IDs of related services or applications**. Note that all specified conditions must match for a monitor to be executed on demand. This ability is only available via API.

  If you specify three monitors by ID and one tag in your POST request, each of the three monitors plus all monitors matching the tag will be executed.
* Automatic assignment of a **batch ID** for all executions of the POST method, whether for a single monitor or multiple monitors. This enables the retrieval of results by batch ID as well.
* The ability to define **custom key-value pairs**, for example, to identify application versions, as part of batch `metadata`. This ability is only available via API. You can define up to 64 pairs per batch, where keys and values can each be up to 1024 characters. Key-value metadata is available in individual as well as batch execution results retrieved via the API and is displayed in the web UI.
* The capture of **screenshots upon success** for browser monitors from public or private locations by setting `"takeScreenshotsOnSuccess": true` in the POST request (the default is `false`). Screenshots upon success are captured from the first location specified for each monitor ID. If no location is specified (for example, when you use tags to define a list of monitors), screenshots are captured from any of the locations assigned to a monitor.

  Note that screenshots are automatically captured upon failure. But if a monitor fails because of a performance threshold violation, it's still considered available, and no screenshots are captured; however, you can enable `takeScreenshotsOnSuccess`.
* The ability to fail an on-demand HTTP monitor execution if the **SSL certificate** is missing, expired, or expiring (`failOnSslWarning` parameter.)
* The ability to **stop triggering all executions in a batch** if there is a problem with triggering any execution (`stopOnProblem` parameter), for example, if the monitor ID is incorrect/missing or the monitor is deleted. This ability is only available via API.
* Retrieval of the **list** of on-demand executions (triggered via the web UI or API by all users in your environment) in the preceding six hours. The list includes execution IDs for each execution. You can filter this list by:

  + Execution and data-delivery timestamps
  + Batch IDs
  + Monitor IDs
  + Location IDs
  + User IDs
* Retrieval of the basic as well as more detailed **results** of an execution (for which you provide an execution ID).

  Basic results are best suited for CI/CD purposes and include the number of requests/events executed, success/failure result, and some key metrics. For example, basic results for HTTP monitors report total request size (for all requests taken together), time to first byte, TLS handshake time, TCP connect time, DNS lookup time, and the final HTTP status code.

  Detailed results are more suitable for troubleshooting. For HTTP monitors, this is the entire set of results visible in the web UI when you opt to [**Analyze execution details**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/synthetic-details-for-http-monitors-classic#analyze-last-execution "Learn about the Synthetic details page for HTTP monitors.").
* **Batch retrieval of results** when you provide a batch ID.

  Batch results include information on executions that were triggered and those that resulted in an outcome.

  Note that the `executedCount` is the number of executions that resulted in success or failure. `failedToExecuteCount` is the number of executions that were triggered but for which results are not available for technical reasons (such as a problem with the ActiveGate or Synthetic engine or results that could not be sent to the Dynatrace Cluster). `executedCount` + `failedToExecuteCount` = `triggeredCount`.
* **Granular permissions** for triggering and retrieving data for on-demand executions.

  To trigger executions (POST), you need rights to create monitors (`ExternalSyntheticIntegration` token scope) or the `syntheticExecutions.write` token scope, which enables you to trigger executions but not create new monitors.

  To retrieve data (GET), you need any of the `ExternalSyntheticIntegration`, `ReadSyntheticData`, or `syntheticExecutions.read` token scopes.

### Best practices

* When you override any credentials in a monitor script, for example, for the Authorization header, be sure that you have access to the updated credential.
* If you override the URL in a browser monitor Navigate event, it's best not to enable screenshots upon success, as the reference screenshots for the event will be overwritten by ones from the customized URL.

# Public Synthetic locations

# Public Synthetic locations

* Reference
* 8-min read
* Updated on Feb 08, 2024

Dynatrace offers a global network of public Synthetic Monitoring locations out of the box. With Dynatrace Synthetic Monitoring, you can run your monitors from public locations that are based on the infrastructure of these major cloud providers: Alibaba Cloud, Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.

Note that you can also [create private Synthetic locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring.") within your own network infrastructure. All public and private Synthetic locations can run [browser as well as HTTP monitors](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/types-of-synthetic-monitors "Learn about Dynatrace synthetic monitor types.").

## Location release stages

Locations are released in one of these progressive stages: **Coming soon**, **Early Adopter**, or **GA**. Locations can also be **Deprecated**. Learn about the relationship between the stages:

| Stage | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Coming soon** | Location is already created; we're performing final performance tests before making the location available. |
| **Deprecated** | Location is about to be removed; you can't assign new monitors to a deprecated location. |
| **Early Adopter** | Location is production ready and fully supported. Its future availability depends on the interest the location receives and on vendor-dependent factors. |
| **GA** | Location is generally available and fully supported. |

## Location IP addresses

If your security policy requires you to add a location IP address to a list of allowed addresses or you need to know this information for other purposes, you can determine a location IP address in one of the following ways.

* When you create or modify your monitors, all the locations and their IP addresses are displayed in the table on the **Frequency and locations** page. Select one or more locations, scroll to the bottom of the page, and select **Copy IPs to clipboard** or **Download IPs** to copy or download the associated IP addresses.
* Use the [Synthetic locations API - GET all locations](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/synthetic/synthetic-locations/get-all-locations "List all synthetic locations via the Synthetic v1 API.") API call, which returns all the locations available for your Environment along with their IP addresses.

## Locations

**All public Synthetic locations are set to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)**.

Location change notice

**The Alibaba Sydney and Mumbai public locations will be discontinued by the end of March 2024**.

Alibaba has announced the closure of data centers in Australia and India, scheduled to take effect by the end of March 2024.

In anticipation of this change, if you use the Alibaba Sydney or Mumbai locations, we recommend reassigning your monitors to alternative locations to ensure that your tests remain functional. If you prefer not to do this yourself, starting from March 2024, we will automatically transfer your monitors to the alternative public locations listed below.

**Summary of change**

| Location to be deprecated by end March 2024 | Recommended alternative location |
| --- | --- |
| **Sydney (Alibaba)** | **Sydney (AWS)** |
| **Mumbai (Alibaba)** | **Mumbai (AWS)** |

Migrate your monitors

If you have synthetic monitors assigned to the soon-to-be-deprecated Sydney (Alibaba) or Mumbai (Alibaba) locations, we recommend that you assign them to other locations. The alternative Sydney (AWS) and Mumbai (AWS) locations would be your natural first choices, but you can, of course, select other locations.

1. Go to **Synthetic Classic** and select a monitor.
2. On the monitor details page, select **Edit**.
3. Select **Frequency and locations**.
4. Clear the **Sydney** (Alibaba) and **Mumbai** (Alibaba) checkboxes and select alternative locations.
5. **Save changes**.

You can also use the [Synthetic Monitors API](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/synthetic/synthetic-monitors "Manage synthetic monitors via the Synthetic v1 API.") for configuration at scale.

Additional actions to update your firewall rules

While we aim to make this transition as seamless as possible, there are specific tasks we can't perform on your behalf, so you might need to take additional actions.

* If you have applications monitored by Dynatrace Synthetic Monitoring, you might need to adjust your firewall configuration to permit incoming traffic from your selected alternative locations to reach your websites.
* After the end of March 2024, the Alibaba Sydney and Mumbai public locations will no longer be accessible. Consequently, you'll also need to remove the associated IP addresses for these locations from your firewall configuration.

For help on determining the new addresses, see [Location IP addresses](#ip-addresses).

# Supported authentication methods in Synthetic Monitoring

# Supported authentication methods in Synthetic Monitoring

* How-to guide
* 9-min read
* Updated on Aug 19, 2025

Dynatrace Synthetic Monitoring offers various methods for monitoring web applications or API endpoints that require authentication. Read on for an overview of the most common scenarios and the appropriate methods to use.

## Browser monitors

The [**HTTP authentication**](#http-bm) and [**certificate authentication**](#certificate-bm) methods are supported for both [single-URL browser monitors](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/create-a-single-url-browser-monitor "Learn how to set up a single-URL browser monitor to check the availability of your site.") and [browser clickpaths](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/record-a-browser-clickpath "Learn how to record a browser clickpath to monitor the availability and performance of your application.").

The [**web form** (**HTML-based**)](#web-form-bm) is supported only for browser clickpaths.

### Web form (HTML-based) authentication for web applications

The most common scenario is a webpage with web form (HTML-based) authentication, which requires you to enter a username and password.

![Web application with HTML-based authentication](https://dt-cdn.net/images/htmlbasedauthentication-2048-c9fcf36a82.png)

You can monitor a transaction in a [browser clickpath](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/record-a-browser-clickpath "Learn how to record a browser clickpath to monitor the availability and performance of your application.") by recording credentials in a web form.

1. Go to **Synthetic Classic** > **Create a synthetic monitor** > **Create a browser monitor**.
2. Specify the monitor name, starting URL, and other options before selecting **Record clickpath** at the bottom of the page.
3. While recording, manually enter the username and password for authentication; Dynatrace automatically captures the credentials.
4. After recording, you have the option of storing the credentials to the [credential vault](/docs/manage/credential-vault "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.").
5. [Complete the configuration](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/configure-browser-monitors "Learn about configuring browser monitors and clickpaths.") of your clickpath.

#### Single-URL monitors with web form authentication

Deprecated

Web form authentication is no longer supported for the single-URL browser monitors. You can instead create [browser clickpath](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/record-a-browser-clickpath "Learn how to record a browser clickpath to monitor the availability and performance of your application.") monitors for the test scenarios that require web form login. Your previously configured single-URL monitors will run as before, but we recommend to re-record them as clickpaths to clearly separate each step of the login process.

Re-recording is required if you want to modify any part of your monitor's configuration. You can no longer save changes in their current format.

Starting from Dynatrace version 1.324+, the single-URL monitors with the web form login will be automatically updated by adding a free JavaScript step to support the login process.

### Basic, digest, NTLM, or Negotiate (Kerberos) authentication for web applications

If you need to monitor a page with a browser-native dialog box (that's not part of the web application) to authenticate (as in the image below), it's likely that the basic, digest, NTLM, or Negotiate authentication methods are used in the background.

Negotiate (Kerberos) is supported for browser monitors executed in [private locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location#kerberos-client-setup "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring.") on

* Windows
* ActiveGate version 1.311+ Linux
* ActiveGate version 1.311+ [Containerized](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/containerized-locations#kerberos "Deploy and manage containerized, auto-scalable private Synthetic locations on Kubernetes/RedHat OpenShift.")

2. In **Additional options**, turn on **Enable global login authentication**.
3. Select either:

   * **HTTP authentication** if the login happens via the native browser dialogue
   * **Kerberos authentication** if the login happens via Kerberos protocol. Fill additional required fields:

     + Domain: User's domain name
     + Auth server allow list: List of allowed servers for Kerberos authentication. Wildcards can be used. Exact details are provided in the [Chrome Enterprise documentationï»¿](https://dt-url.net/p803wkm)
4. Either use an existing credential from the [credential vault](/docs/manage/credential-vault "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.") (**Select credentials**) or **Create new credentials**.
5. [Complete the configuration](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/configure-browser-monitors "Learn about configuring browser monitors and clickpaths.") of your single-URL browser monitor.

1. Go to **Synthetic Classic** > **Create a synthetic monitor** > **Create a browser monitor**.
2. Specify the monitor name, starting URL, and other options before selecting **Record clickpath** at the bottom of the page.
3. While recording, manually enter the username and password in the browser-native dialog box.
4. When done recording, open the first [Navigate event](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/browser-clickpath-events#navigate "Learn about the event types created when recording a browser clickpath.") of your clickpath and turn on **Enable HTTP authentication**.

   ![Navigate event HTTP authentication](https://dt-cdn.net/images/navigatehttpauthentication-652-d4048163be.png)
5. Either use an existing credential from the [credential vault](/docs/manage/credential-vault "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.") (**Select credentials**) or **Create new credentials**.

   Your clickpath will automatically use these credentials to authenticate via the browser-native login dialog.
6. To use Kerberos authentication, select **Kerberos authentication**. Authentication will be done by receiving Kerberos tickets for provided credentials from the Kerberos Key Distribution Center.

   ![Kerberos Authentication](https://dt-cdn.net/images/kerberosauth-608-429fe9ac73.png)

   * Domain: User's domain name

* HTTP monitors: `<username>`
* **NTLM authentication** in browser and HTTP monitors: `<username>`

### Client certificate authentication for web applications

Certificate authentication is available for browser monitors executed from any [public location](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/public-synthetic-locations "Learn about all currently available public Synthetic Monitoring locations.") and on Linux-based [private locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring."). Once you set up your browser monitor, you need to specify client certificate details in the **Advanced setup** tab of monitor settings in edit mode.

Monitor a single page

Transaction in a recorded clickpath

1. Go to **Synthetic Classic** > **Create a synthetic monitor** > **Create a browser monitor**.
2. Specify the monitor URL and name.

   You cannot specify a client certificate when initially setting up a single-URL browser monitor.
3. [Complete the configuration](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/configure-browser-monitors "Learn about configuring browser monitors and clickpaths.") of your single-URL browser monitor.

1. Before first recording a clickpath on a website that requires certificate authentication, ensure that you have installed the required certificate in Chrome.
2. Go to **Synthetic Classic** > **Create a synthetic monitor** > **Create a browser monitor**.
3. Specify the monitor name, starting URL, and other options before selecting **Record clickpath** at the bottom of the page.
4. When you navigate to the website in the recording window, the native browser dialog simply selects the correct certificate that you've installed in Chrome. After you record the clickpath, you need to specify the certificate to use for monitor execution, as described below.

Next, in edit mode, add client certificates for browser monitor execution.

1. Select the **Advanced setup** tab in browser monitor settings.
2. Turn on **Use client certificates**.
3. Select **Add client certificate**.
4. Enter the **Domain** that the certificate is valid for.
5. Select a credential from the list of certificate credentials displayed. Alternatively, select **Create new credential** to upload and use a new client certificate. Any certificate credential you create is automatically designated as [owner only](/docs/manage/credential-vault#work-with-credentials "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.") and stored in the [credential vault](/docs/manage/credential-vault "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.").

   You can specify and upload certificate files in PFX, P12, or PEM format.

   ![Certificate authentication setting for browser monitors](https://dt-cdn.net/images/bm-client-certificates-788-4347c846d7.png)
6. Select **Add entry**.
7. Repeat these steps to add multiple certificates for use in your clickpath. However, each certificate must be tied to a single domain.
8. **Save changes**.

## HTTP monitors

HTTP monitors support basic, NTLM, token, OAuth 2.0, or certificate-based authentication.

### Basic or NTLM authentication for endpoints

1. Go to **Synthetic Classic** > **Create a synthetic monitor** > **Create an HTTP monitor**.
2. Select **Add HTTP request** and choose the **HTTP request** type.
3. In the **Additional options** of the request, **Set authentication/authorization**.
4. Select **Basic authentication** or **NTLM**.
5. Either use an existing credential from the [credential vault](/docs/manage/credential-vault "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.") (**Select credentials**) or **Create new credentials**.

   Dynatrace automatically generates the required `Authorization` header with the information you've provided.

   Supported username formats

   * Browser monitors: `<username>` and `<domain>\<username>`
   * HTTP monitors: `<username>`
   * **NTLM authentication** in browser and HTTP monitors: `<username>`
6. Finish [configuring your HTTP monitor](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/configure-http-monitors-classic "Learn about configuring HTTP monitors.").

### Bearer or token authentication for endpoints

1. Go to **Synthetic Classic** > **Create a synthetic monitor** > **Create an HTTP monitor**.
2. Select **Add HTTP request** and choose the **HTTP request** type.
3. In the **Additional options** of the request, **Set additional HTTP headers**.
4. Select **Add header**.
5. Fill out the header, for example, set:

   **Header name** = `Authorization`

   **Header value** = `Bearer <your-token>`

   or

   **Header name** = `Authorization`

   **Header value** = `Api-Token <your-token>`
6. Finish [configuring your HTTP monitor](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/configure-http-monitors-classic "Learn about configuring HTTP monitors.").

### OAuth 2.0 authorization for endpoints

OAuth 2.0 authorization is available for HTTP monitors and is most commonly used when querying API endpoints. Dynatrace provides the **OAuth2 authorization request** type, which is a specialized HTTP request template for OAuth 2.0 authorization requests.

You first need to set up an OAuth 2.0 request for an access token, which you then use in all subsequent HTTP requests in your monitor that queries the API endpoint. The returned token is not stored to the credential vault, but it's easily accessible as an autocomplete option in your subsequent HTTP requests.

1. Go to **Synthetic Classic** > **Create a synthetic monitor** > **Create an HTTP monitor** and provide a **Name**.
2. Select **Add HTTP request** and choose the **OAth2 authorization request** type.
3. Enter the URL from which you're requesting an authorization token (**Access token URL**) and request **Name**.
4. Select **Add HTTP request** to view expanded request settings. Note that the OAuth 2.0 request is automatically created as a `POST` request.
5. Fill out or edit these important settings in the request details.

   1. Depending on how your authentication server is set up, opt to **Add authorization data to** the **Request body** or **Request URL**. Fill out the POST parameters (`grant_Type`, `scope`, `client_id`, `username`, and `password`) in the **Request body** or **Request URL**. You can add or modify parameters as needed.

      ![OAuth parameters in request body](https://dt-cdn.net/images/oauthparamsbody1-1171-5bbbc6be5d.png)

      ![OAuth parameters in request URL](https://dt-cdn.net/images/oauthparamsurl-1314-353802a4b5.png)
   2. A **post-execution script** is automatically enabled, where:

      * The request fails if the returned status code is not `200`.
      * The `api.fail()` method defines the **Failure message** that appears in case of failure in the **Events** card on the [HTTP monitor details page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/synthetic-details-for-http-monitors-classic "Learn about the Synthetic details page for HTTP monitors.") and in [execution details](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/synthetic-details-for-http-monitors-classic#analyze-last-execution "Learn about the Synthetic details page for HTTP monitors.").
      * If the request is successful, the response body, which is a JSON-formatted string, is stored in a JavaScript object (called `bearToken-2` in this example).
      * The `api.info()` method sends information to a log file, which is accessible on [private Synthetic locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring.").

      Custom log messages also appear in the `customLogs` attribute in [HTTP monitor execution details](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/synthetic-details-for-http-monitors-classic#analyze-last-execution "Learn about the Synthetic details page for HTTP monitors.").

      ![Post-execution script](https://dt-cdn.net/images/oauthpostexecutionscript-812-911fe199bc.png)
   3. **Set token request authentication** enables you to specify additional authentication details (**Basic authentication**, **NTLM**, or **Kerberos**) for the server that the OAuth application sits behind.

For subsequent HTTP requests

1. Create an additional HTTP request for the endpoint you need to monitor (**Add HTTP request**).
2. In the **Additional options** of the second request:

   * Enable **Set authentication/authorization** and select the **OAuth2** method. Note that this option is only available if you've first created an OAuth 2.0 authorization request (described above).

     An autogenerated **pre-execution script** referencing the OAuth token received in the request created above is displayed.

     ![OAuth method in HTTP request](https://dt-cdn.net/images/oauthtokeninsert1-1129-0244726c35.png)
   * As an alternative, set an HTTP `Authorization` header with the JavaScript object containing the OAuth token as the **Header value**.

     ![OAuth method in HTTP request](https://dt-cdn.net/images/oauthtokeninsert2-1214-783de8da93.png)
3. Finish [configuring your HTTP monitor](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/configure-http-monitors-classic "Learn about configuring HTTP monitors.").

### Client certificate authentication for endpoints

1. Go to **Synthetic Classic** > **Create a synthetic monitor** > **Create an HTTP monitor** and provide a **Name**.
2. Select **Add HTTP request** and choose the **HTTP request** type.
3. In the **Additional options** of the request, **Add client certificate**.
4. Either use an existing certificate from the [credential vault](/docs/manage/credential-vault "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.") (**Select credentials**) or **Create new credentials**.
5. Finish [configuring your HTTP monitor](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/configure-http-monitors-classic "Learn about configuring HTTP monitors.").

To assure full mutual authentication, disable [**Accept any SSL certificate**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/configure-http-monitors-classic#ssl-accept "Learn about configuring HTTP monitors.") when using certificate authentication.

# Synthetic calculations

# Synthetic calculations

* Explanation
* 4-min read
* Updated on Aug 28, 2025

Dynatrace uses specific formulas to calculate metric values and generate problems based on these metrics.

## Availability

Availability calculation for a synthetic monitor isn't based on the number of successful executions but on the length of time (duration) that a monitor is considered to be `UP`. Dynatrace stores timestamps of state changesâ`UP`, `DOWN`, and `UNMONITORED`.

The timespan covered by successive successful monitor executions is considered to be uptime (`UP`). The time between the last successful execution and the first failed execution is also considered to be uptime (`UP`). Likewise, the timespan covered by successive failed executions is considered to be downtime (`DOWN`). The time between the last failed execution and the first successful execution is considered to be downtime (`DOWN`). This is illustrated in the image below.

The time that a monitor spends in the `UNMONITORED` state isn't considered in availability calculations.

* **Uptime** is the duration in ms during which a synthetic monitor is in state `UP`.
* **Downtime** is the duration in ms during which a synthetic monitor is in state `DOWN`.
* **Availability % per location** is `Uptime / (Uptime + Downtime) Ã 100`.
* **Overall availability of a monitor** is the `sum of availability % per location / number of locations`.

Availability is stored as a percentage with two decimal places.

![Availability calculation](https://dt-cdn.net/images/syntheticavailabilitycalculation-1729-851771b70f.png)

## Maintenance windows

Maintenance windows can be excluded from availability calculation for synthetic monitors, displayed, for example, in **Synthetic Classic**, [synthetic monitor details pages](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/synthetic-details-for-browser-monitors "Analyze browser monitor and clickpath results on the Synthetic details page."), and reports. A global setting enables you to always exclude maintenance windows from availability calculationsâgo to **Settings** > **Web and mobile monitoring** > **Synthetic availability** to access it.

![Availability calculation](https://dt-cdn.net/images/maintenancewindowsavailability-901-6ba52f57f9.png)

Outages that occur within such excluded maintenance windows are shown, for example, in graphs and data points on the [**Multidimensional analysis** page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/multidimensional-analysis-for-browser-monitors "Learn how to analyze browser-monitor data points."). Any failing resources are highlighted in [waterfall graphs](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/waterfall-graphs "How to analyze page resource downloads for browser monitors."). However, failed executions are not included in availability calculations for the maintenance periods.

This setting also applies to retroactive maintenance windows. That is, you can exclude a retroactive maintenance window from synthetic availability calculations for the same period. Note, however, that maintenance windows are not retroactively excluded from any reports that were generated before the maintenance windows were created.

[Data Explorer](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/explorer "Query for metrics and transform results to gain desired insights.") charts and the [Metrics API](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/metric-v2 "Retrieve metric information via Metrics v2 API.") provide availability metrics with the option of including or excluding maintenance windows.

## Retries

Retry on error for single-URL browser monitors and browser clickpaths is configurable via [monitor settings](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/configure-browser-monitors#outage-handling "Learn about configuring browser monitors and clickpaths.") and is enabled by default. Discarded executions are ignored in availability calculations.

* **Browser monitors:** Automatic retry (first unsuccessful execution is ignored) when option is enabled in monitor settings
* **HTTP monitors:** No retries

## Key performance metrics

**Total duration** is calculated as a summation of the **User action duration** of the load and XHR actions in a monitor. Other [key performance metric](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/work-with-key-performance-metrics "Learn how to use the right key performance metrics to optimize user experience data for each of your applications.") values are averages, calculated separately for load actions and XHR actions.

## Performance problems, resolution, and timeouts

Dynatrace generates a performance problem if a monitor at a given location violates **any** of the defined performance thresholds in 3 of the 5 most recent executions, unless there is an open maintenance window for the monitor. That is, the violations must occur at the same location. Multiple locations can have such violations and be included in a problem.

A problem is not created, for example, if your monitor runs from 3 locations, and each location has 1 violation.

Many locations, each with 3 violations in the 5 most recent executions, can be part of the same problem if the violations occur around the same time. If the violations are further apart in time, separate problems are generated for each location.

The problem is closed if the performance thresholds are not violated in the 5 most recent executions at each of the previously affected locations.

Performance problem resolution occurs when a monitor is enabled/active. If a monitor is disabled/inactive, open performance problems are closed, or time out, after 10 minutes.

### Performance thresholds

Performance thresholds for [browser monitors](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/types-of-synthetic-monitors "Learn about Dynatrace synthetic monitor types.") are defined as the **Total duration** of the monitor or of individual events, which, in turn, can comprise multiple load or XHR actions. Total duration is the sum of the User action durations of the constituent actions. Where an event has just one action, Total duration is the same as the User action duration.

Note that Total duration is not available as a metric for individual load or XHR actions when viewing browser monitor [Multidimensional analysis](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/multidimensional-analysis-for-browser-monitors "Learn how to analyze browser-monitor data points.") or a [waterfall graph](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/waterfall-graphs "How to analyze page resource downloads for browser monitors.").

Performance thresholds for [HTTP monitors](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/types-of-synthetic-monitors#http-monitor "Learn about Dynatrace synthetic monitor types.") are defined as the **Response time** of the monitor or of individual requests.

## Availability problems, resolution, and timeouts

Synthetic monitors can experience global outage or local outage availability problems. A global outage occurs when all locations experience 1â5 consecutive failures simultaneously. A local outage occurs when the specified number of locations experiences the specified number of consecutive failures, for example, when 3 of 4 total locations experience two consecutive failures.

An outage problem is resolved when there are as many consecutive successful executions as the configured number of failed executions for generating the problem. The successful executions must occur on the number of locations that = the total number of locationsâthe number of locations required for the problem+1.

For example, for your monitor running on 4 locations configured to generate a problem when 3 locations have 2 consecutive failures, an outage problem is resolved when there are 2 consecutive successful executions on 2 (=4â3+1) locations.

Note that when a global outage problem is resolved, you might still have one or more locations experiencing monitor failure. Set up local outage rules to be alerted on these.

Outage problem resolution occurs when a monitor is enabled/active. If a monitor is disabled/inactive, open outage problems are closed, or time out, if there are no new executions for 2x the monitor frequency. For example, if a monitor scheduled to run every hour and has an open outage problem when it is disabled at 7:00 AM, the problem times out at 9:00 AM (2 Ã 1 hour).

# HTTP monitor metrics

# HTTP monitor metrics

* Explanation
* 1-min read
* Published Dec 04, 2020

The following metrics are captured and displayed for synthetic [HTTP monitors](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/types-of-synthetic-monitors "Learn about Dynatrace synthetic monitor types."):

Response time
:   Measures the HTTP monitor or event performance.  
    **Response time** is the sum of **DNS lookup time**, **TCP connect time**, **TLS handshake time**, **Waiting**, and **Download**.

DNS lookup time
:   The time taken to resolve the host nameâif there are multiple DNS calls because of a redirect, this is the total time of all DNS calls.

TCP connect time
:   The time taken to establish the TCP connectionâif there are multiple TCP connections because of a redirect, this is the total time of TCP connection attempts.

TLS handshake time
:   The time taken to complete the TLS handshake

Waiting
:   The time taken for the server to respond with the first byteâthis is the **Time to first byte** minus (**DNS lookup time** + **TCP connect time** + **TLS handshake time**).  
    Note that **Time to first byte** is the amount of time from the start of the request until the first byte of the response is received.

Download
:   The time taken to download the HTTP response  
    Download time can be 0 when the response is contained within a single packet. Download time can also be 0 when the network is slow. In such cases, we report network latency in **Waiting** time.

# Configure a NAM monitor

# Configure a NAM monitor

* How-to guide
* 1-min read
* Updated on Jan 19, 2026

With network availability monitors (NAM), you can check the availability of your hosts, devices, and services.

There are three types of NAM monitors: ICMP, TCP, and DNS. To learn more about them, see [NAM types](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/network-availability-monitors/network-availability-monitoring#NAM-types "ICMP, TCP, and DNS synthetic monitors").
You can create NAM monitors in [![Synthetic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-new-256-1ddb35ac79.png "Synthetic") Synthetic](#monitor-configuration) in latest Dynatrace or through [API](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/network-availability-monitors/create-a-nam-monitor#nam-api "Learn how to set up a NAM monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.").

## NAM setup

With NAM monitors, you can include more than one step.

* Each step can contain one or multiple requests.
* Like for HTTP and browser monitors, steps are executed sequentially.
* Unlike for HTTP and browser monitors, NAM monitors can contain multiple requests within a single step. All requests assigned to a particular step are executed in parallel. If one request fails, it doesn't affect the execution of other requests within that step.
* A step is skipped if nothing matches its definition in a monitor configuration. For example, when a tag is specified in the [target filters](#target-filter) list but nothing matches the tag.
* Concept of requests executed in parallel exists for NAM monitors only

For example, if you want to monitor a group of 4 hosts with an ICMP test, you want to apply the same conditions (such as frequency, location executing test, and number of packets) for each host from your group.

NAM offers you the possibility of addressing this in multiple ways:

* You can define 4 separate tests, one per host. The benefit of this approach is that Dynatrace triggers a separate problem for each host and you can assign separate notifications for each one. You can also adjust test parameters for each host separately.
* You can define a single test with 4 requests (within 1 step). The same ICMP checks are executed, but there will be differences in reporting and alerting. The number or percentage of hosts that are down is reported with the Requests Success rate metric. You can configure a customized threshold for failing the whole monitor. For example, if it's OK that 1 out of 4 hosts is down, because of rolling out an update, you can define it on the `>=75%` level. There's always a single problem generated for a monitor, yet still, it contains detailed info about hosts that don't respond. Another benefit of this approach is easier maintenance (adjusting single setting for all 4 hosts).

  Finally, filters offer defining tests against dynamically changing structure, for example if you want to define ICMP tests against a given host group, you don't need to adjust the NAM monitor test after the host group configuration change.

You need to define constraints for each monitor. Constraints are conditions that need to be met to consider the monitorâs execution successful. It is obligatory to define the **Success rate** constraint. See [step-level constraints](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/network-availability-monitors/create-a-nam-monitor#step-level-constraints "Learn how to set up a NAM monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.") to learn more.

## Create a NAM monitor

To create a NAM monitor in latest Dynatrace

1. Go to ![Synthetic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-new-256-1ddb35ac79.png "Synthetic") **Synthetic** and select **Create monitor**.
2. Follow the on-screen steps as outlined in the sections below.

### Select type

The **Create synthetic monitor** page shows the types of synthetic monitor you can create.

Select **Network monitor (NAM)** to get started.

### General

* Required **Name this monitor**âThe name of the monitor as it will be displayed in the web UI (up to 500 characters).
* Required **Select a protocol**âChoose the monitor type: `DNS`, `ICMP`, or `TCP`.
* Optional **Set a description**âDescribe your monitor.
* Optional **Add tags to this monitor**âTo manually create a new tag, select **Add tag**, type the key, optionally provide a value, and select **Add**.

After you specify the general settings, select **Continue**.

### Requests

The **Requests** section has two editing modes. You can switch back and forth between these modes.

* default **Visual**âto view and configure NAM requests through web UI settings.
* **Script**âto view and edit request settings as JSON. The script you provide also serves as payload for API requests.

Settings per request (you can add multiple requests) are:

* Required **Request name**âThe name of the request.
* Required **List of targets** or **Filter expression**

  + You can provide targets for requests as an explicit list, or filter monitored hosts using a filter expression.

    - If you want to provide targets as IP or domain names, use **List of targets** to specify a comma-separated list of targets. Use this to monitor single or multiple hosts, devices, or services.
    - If you want to select some of the monitored hosts or custom devices, use **Filter expression** to specify a filter expression. This allows you to monitor a group of hosts or custom devices that meet the filter criteria. To learn more about available filters, see [target filter](#target-filter).

    You can combine both the **List of targets** and the **Filter expression** in a single monitor step. When used together, the monitor step will include the combined set of targets from both fields.
* Required **Execution attributes**âExecution attributes are essentially key/value pairs that are associated with your request. Define **Request timeout**, **Number of packets**, **Data length**, **Time to live**, **Timeout to reply**, you can also turn on or turn off **Do not fragment data**. Execution attributes are available for ICMP only.
* Required **Constraints**âConstraints are conditions that need to be met to consider monitorâs execution successful. You need to define **Constraint type**, **Operator** and **value**.

If you want to create another request, select **Add next request** and specify the above for the next request.

Use **Duplicate** ![Duplicate](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-app-tile-duplicate-f0d63fb901.svg "Duplicate") to duplicate a request and then edit it from that point instead of starting from scratch each time you add a request.

After you specify all requests, select **Continue**.

### Frequency and locations

In the **Frequency and locations** section, specify the frequency and locations.

* Required **Select frequency**âYou can choose a frequency (every `1 min`, `2 min`, `5 min`, `10 min`, `15 min`, `30 min`, or `1 h`) or select `On demand only` for manual execution.
* Required **n selected locations**âSpecify one or more locations.

After you specify the frequency and locations, select **Continue**.

### Outage and Performance

In **Outage handling**, you can enable and configure the following settings related to problem and alert generation:

* Optional "Generate a problem and send an alert when the monitor is unavailable at all configured locations (global outage)."
* Optional "Generate a problem and send an alert when the monitor is unavailable only when at least two locations are assigned." Note that this option is only possible if you selected two or more locations.
* Optional "Generate a problem and send an alert on performance threshold violations."

After you specify the outage and performance settings, select **Continue**.

### Summary

In the **Summary** section, verify your settings.

After you review the summary, select **Save** to create your monitor or **Back** to go back and adjust your monitor settings.

## Target filter

Target filter gives an option to filter **hosts monitored by Dynatrace** or **custom devices having IP addresses**. With this filter, you can select those two types of targets based on:

* type (`type`)
* tags (`tag`)
* host ID (`hostId`) (deprecated, works for hosts only, use entity ID instead)
* entity ID (`entityId`)
* host groups (`hostGroup`)
* management zones (`managementZone`)
* IP mask (`ipMask`)
* IP range (`ipRange`)
* process group instance (`processGroupInstance`)
* network interfaces of particular custom device (`interfacesOf`)
* extension name (`extensionName`)

IP range and IP mask are filters for hosts or devices known for the Dynatrace server, not an option to scan the network.

### Syntax

* Logical operators: `AND` and `OR` (case insensitive)
* Parentheses
* Expression operators: `==` and `!=`
* Tag names and values
* Negation ("not"): `!=`.
* Wildcard: `*` (selects all hosts monitored by Dynatrace)

### Examples

* `tag == tagname or hostGroup == group1`
* `(tag == tagname1:tagvalue1 or tag == tagname1:tagvalue2) and (hostGroup == group1 or managementZone == zone1)`
* `tag != tagname1 and tag != tagname2:tagvalue`
* `tag == tagname:tagvalue and (managementZone == zone1 or managementZone == zone2)`
* `tag == "[tagwithbrackets and spaces]":"value, with, commas, and, spaces"`
* `ipMask == 127.0.0.1/24`
* `hostId == HOST-000123`
* `type == CUSTOM_DEVICE and ipMask == 172.17.0.2/24`
* `entityId == HOST-045BFCDA3F507D30 or entityId == CUSTOM_DEVICE-13081D4B74B3E2C8`
* `type == HOST and processGroupInstance == PROCESS_GROUP_INSTANCE-07611353BB98908C`
* `type == CUSTOM_DEVICE and interfacesOf == CUSTOM_DEVICE-E1A88946BF04D5E7`
* `type == CUSTOM_DEVICE and extensionName == "Docker devices"`

## Performance thresholds

The performance threshold metric is compared to metric calculated for each request within monitor/step. For example, if TCP port check monitor, tests on the same host port `80` and `443` separately, Dynatrace compares threshold TCP connection establishment time twice, once for port `80` and once for port `443`.

There are three performance metrics for three types of NAM monitors:

* RTT for ICMP
* TCP connection establishment time for TCP
* DNS resolution time for DNS

Violating defined performance triggers a Problem (Slowdown).

Similarly to availability problems:

* Problems are opened per monitor
* Contains information about all requests responsible for problem

You can configure the way Dynatrace aggregates results for each packet for ICMP requests with single execution. Dynatrace supports AVG, MAX and MIN with `AVG` as the default method.

### Define thresholds

You can define performance thresholds when configuring the request for your synthetic monitor. The defined performance threshold is the same for all requests within a single step. In cases, where there's a need to build a multi-step NAM monitor, it's possible to define various thresholds for each step.

To define thresholds

1. Follow the steps described in [Create a NAM monitor](#monitor-configuration) section.
2. In the **Requests** step, scroll down the page and see **Performance thresholds alerting** section.
3. Select **Generate a problem and send an alert on performance threshold violations.** check box.
4. Turn on **Advanced performance thresholds settings** toggle.

   In this section you can set the **Number of request executions in analyzed sliding window** and the **Number of violating request executions in analyzed sliding window**. For de-alerting samples we require `n` most recent non-violating request executions.

### Violation reporting

Red color annotation over performance charts indicates the period of time during which the performance threshold is raised. Additionally, a threshold is drawn on the performance chart, and you can examine which requests are above the threshold.

You may narrow down the time range only to that for which the problem was active using zoom functionality.

## Manage NAM monitors with API

## Script configuration constraints

Constraints are conditions that need to be met to consider monitorâs execution successful. You need to define constraints for each monitor.

### Step-level constraints

#### `SUCCESS_RATE_PERCENT`

Required

This is an obligatory constraint for all monitors' request success rate. The default value is `>=80%`.

Percentage of successful requests in a step.

Actual success rate = ratio of the number of requests that didn't fail to all requests.

For example, if 1 request out of 6 has failed, the ratio is (6-1)/6 = 83.33%.

| Property | Type | Description | Value | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `operator` | string | Comparison operator to compare actual and expected value | `>=`, `>`, `<=`, `<`, `=`, or `!=` | `>=` |
| `value` | integer | Expected value of success rate to use for comparison | Range = `0`â`100` | `80` |

```
{



"type": "SUCCESS_RATE_PERCENT",



"properties": {



"value": "80",



"operator": ">"



}



}
```

For requests with only one target, we suggest setting the constraints values to `100`.

### Request-level constraints

#### ICMP request constraints

##### `ICMP_SUCCESS_RATE_PERCENT`

Required

This is an obligatory constraint for ICMP monitors request success rate. The default value is `>=80%`.

Percentage of successful pings (echo requests) in a request.

Actual success rate = ratio of number of the packets received to number of packets sent.

For example, if 5 packets were sent and 4 packets were received, the ratio is 4/5 = 80.00%.

| Property | Type | Description | Value | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `operator` | string | Comparison operator to compare actual and expected value | `>=`, `>`, `<=`, `<`, `=`, or `!=` | `>=` |
| `value` | integer | Expected value of success rate to use for comparison | Range = `0`â`100` | `80` |

```
{



"type": "ICMP_SUCCESS_RATE_PERCENT",



"properties": {



"value": "80",



"operator": ">"



}



}
```

#### TCP request constraints

##### `TCP_PORT_UNREACHABLE`

Optional

This is an optional constraint for TCP monitors.
This is a special constraint that inverts the [execution status](#execution-statuses) for TCP requests. It should be applied if it's expected that the port being checked is unreachable.

This constraint has no configuration properties.

If this constraint is applied:

* When the `Execution timeout (12033)` and `TCP socket connection error (22000)` statuses are detected after performing a connection attempt, they are interpreted as `HEALTHY (0)`.
* The `HEALTHY (0)` connection status is interpreted as `CONSTRAINT_VIOLATED (1401)` because we expected a failure.
* The `UNEXPECTED_ERROR (-1)` and `UNKNOWN_HOST (12013)` statuses are preserved and reported as is.

```
{



"type": "TCP_PORT_UNREACHABLE",



"properties": {}



}
```

#### DNS request constraints

At least one required

DNS constraints are **optional**, but at least one must be defined to indicate what is a successful query.

## DQL queries to extract data

Use [DQL](/docs/platform/grail/dynatrace-query-language "How to use Dynatrace Query Language.") queries to extract data with metrics and dimensions.

The following examples use [Notebooks](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/dashboards-and-notebooks/notebooks "Analyze, visualize, and share insights from your observability dataâall in one collaborative, customizable workspace.") ![Notebooks](https://dt-cdn.net/images/notebooks-768-046137830a.webp "Notebooks") to demonstrate how to work with the results of network availability monitors. They use result metrics as a starting point to explore possibilities of extracting and interpreting data with DQL.

### Host entity status for ICMP requests

The monitor `MULTIPROTOCOL_MONITOR-5C2F92334DF71A90` executes ICMP requests and filters monitored hosts with `"targetFilter": "hostGroup == e2e-synthetic-private-location"` (which resolves to about 26 hosts).

By using the `dt.synthetic.multi_protocol.request.executions` metric and splitting it by the `dt.entity.host` and `result.status.message` dimensions, we can display the status of the connection to a particular monitored host entity in this host group. Some hosts do not fulfill the expected success rate; instead of being `HEALTHY`, their requests are marked as `CONSTRAINT_VIOLATED`.

```
Timeseries status = avg(dt.synthetic.multi_protocol.request.executions),



by:{dt.entity.host, result.status.message},



filter: dt.entity.multiprotocol_monitor == "MULTIPROTOCOL_MONITOR-5C2F92334DF71A90"
```

![Host entity status for ICMP requests](https://dt-cdn.net/images/nam-tcp-connect-ports-notebooks-dql-1920-06e2eeb631.webp)

### Number of ICMP packets sent and received

The monitor `MULTIPROTOCOL_MONITOR-548C3CD54183CED9` executes ICMP requests to hosts with the explicitly defined IP addresses, `18.x.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`, and `34.x.x.x`. Each of these IP addresses maps to a distinct host.

We use the sum of the `dt.synthetic.multi_protocol.icmp.packets_sent` and the sum of the `dt.synthetic.multi_protocol.icmp.packets_received` metrics to get insight into how many packets were sent and received.

We split results by the `request.target_address` dimension and filter data for `18.x.x.x` and `10.x.x.x` only.

For `18.x.x.x`, the same number of packets were received as were sent, but for `10.x.x.x`, all packets are lost and none were received.

```
timeseries {



packets_sent = sum(dt.synthetic.multi_protocol.icmp.packets_sent),



packets_received= sum(dt.synthetic.multi_protocol.icmp.packets_received)



},



by:{request.target_address},



filter: dt.entity.multiprotocol_monitor == "MULTIPROTOCOL_MONITOR-548C3CD54183CED9"



AND (



request.target_address == "18.x.x.x"



OR request.target_address == "10.x.x.x"



)
```

![ICMP packets sent and received](https://dt-cdn.net/images/nam-icmp-packets-notebooks-dql-1638-3577d87f09.webp)

### Target status for TCP requests

The monitor `MULTIPROTOCOL_MONITOR-74E68F22FF5E9227` executes TCP requests to hosts from a host group that resolves to the IP addresses `18.x.x.x`, `34.x.x.x`, and `44.x.x.x`.

To display the status of the TCP connection for an IP-port pair, we use the `dt.synthetic.multi_protocol.request.executions` metric and splitting it by the dimensions:

* `request.target_address`
* `request.tcp_port_number`
* `result.status.message`

In this example:

* Each host has the ports `22` (SSH) and `8080` (HTTP server) open, and each connection to the hosts on these ports succeeds with the `HEALTHY` status.
* No service uses the standard HTTP port `80`. Therefore, connections to all hosts on that port fail with the `TCP socket connection error` status.

Note that results of this query can be limited to just successful requests by filtering by the `multi_protocol.result.status.code` dimension (`code == 0`).

```
timeseries status = sum(dt.synthetic.multi_protocol.request.executions),



by: {request.target_address, request.tcp_port_number, result.status.message},



filter: dt.entity.multiprotocol_monitor == "MULTIPROTOCOL_MONITOR-74E68F22FF5E9227"



//  and result.status.code == 0
```

![Target status for TCP requests](https://dt-cdn.net/images/nam-target-status-tcp-requests-notebooks-dql-1727-4326a4411c.webp)

### TCP connection time to target port

The monitor `MULTIPROTOCOL_MONITOR-74E68F22FF5E9227` executes TCP requests to hosts from a host group that resolves to the IP addresses `18.x.x.x`, `34.x.x.x`, and `44.x.x.x`.

In this example, instead of IP addresses, we split the results by monitored host entity IDs.

To check typical time taken for a successful connection to the target port for a host, we use the average of the `dt.synthetic.multi_protocol.tcp.connection_time` metric split by the dimensions:

* `dt.entity.host`
* `request.target_address`
* `request.tcp_port_number`

Only ports `22` (SSH) and `8080` (HTTP server) are open, and these are the only ports for which `dt.synthetic.multi_protocol.tcp.connection_time` is available. The hosts are effectively in different geographical locations (Ohio, Oregon, and North Virginia in the United States), so a difference in connection times is expected.

```
timeseries duration = avg(dt.synthetic.multi_protocol.tcp.connection_time),



by:{dt.entity.host, request.target_address, request.tcp_port_number},



filter: dt.entity.multiprotocol_monitor == "MULTIPROTOCOL_MONITOR-74E68F22FF5E9227"
```

## Execution statuses

### All network availability monitors

| Code / message | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0 HEALTHY` | - | All is well. |
| `-1 UNEXPECTED_ERROR` | Resource saturation | Unexpected problem that's usually related to monitor's execution components. |
| `1401 CONSTRAINT_VIOLATED` | - | Constraint conditions that were defined in monitor's configuration were not met. |
| `1604 VALIDATION_ERROR` | - | Improper monitor configuration detected. |
| `12013 UNKNOWN_HOST` | Error in the hostname | IP address of the host cannot be determined. Possible causes: - Invalid hostname - DNS server unreachable - DNS cache issues - Firewall or proxy interference |
| `12033 Execution timeout` | Server operates slowly. | Timeout of request execution. Possible causes: - Network issues - Slow or unresponsive server or service - Connection blocked by firewall rules - Timeout is too small. |

### TCP monitor execution statuses

| Code / message | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `22000 TCP socket connection error` | Service is not listening on a specified port. | This status means that the host was identified and available but the TCP connection could not be established or was unexpectedly closed. Additional explanation for the exact exception is provided. The status is used if a `java.net.SocketException` is thrown during the connection attempt. Possible causes: - Service is not listening on the specified port. - Service reached resource or connection limit. - Service became unavailable during the socket connection process. |

# Network availability monitoring

# Network availability monitoring

* Explanation
* 4-min read
* Updated on Aug 08, 2024

Dynatrace version 1.296+ ActiveGate version 1.295+

Network availability monitoring (NAM) allows you to monitor the availability of remote hosts or services over the network when an HTTP/HTTPS endpoint isn't available.

You can use NAM for infrastructure-related use cases or to deepen the root cause analysis for [HTTP](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic "Learn about HTTP monitors.") and [browser](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors "Learn about browser monitors.") monitors.

You can create synthetic network availability monitors of **ICMP**, **TCP**, or **DNS** [type](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/network-availability-monitors/network-availability-monitoring#nam-types "ICMP, TCP, and DNS synthetic monitors").

You can configure NAM monitors and access their performance results in [Synthetic](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app "View the synthetic monitors in your environment, search for monitors, and get a quick overview of a selected monitor.") in latest Dynatrace.
See [create a NAM monitor](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/network-availability-monitors/create-a-nam-monitor "Learn how to set up a NAM monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.") to learn how to set up your monitor in [Synthetic](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app "View the synthetic monitors in your environment, search for monitors, and get a quick overview of a selected monitor.") or via [API](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/network-availability-monitors/create-a-nam-monitor#nam-api "Learn how to set up a NAM monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.").

## NAM types

There are three types of network availability monitors.

* ICMPâSends pings with a configurable number of packets or size to validate if there's a network connection to the host or device. It also checks the quality of that connection.
* TCPâEstablishes a TCP connection to a particular port. It validates if a port is open and if it accepts TCP connections. It also checks if a host is available through the network.
* DNSâValidates if a hostname can be resolved to an IP address.

To find out more about NAM types, see [available script configuration properties](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/network-availability-monitors/create-a-nam-monitor#script-properties "Learn how to set up a NAM monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.").

## Problems

Problems are created on the monitor level.

To receive alerts when problems are generated

1. Edit the monitor.
2. Go to [Outage and Performance](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/network-availability-monitors/create-a-nam-monitor#monitor-configuration "Learn how to set up a NAM monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.").
3. Configure the problems and alerts you want to generate.

To analyze a problem

1. In the **Problems** section of the preview panel, select **Open in Problems app**.
2. In the **Problems app**, you'll see monitors affected by problems, where each problem consists of:

   * Affected stepsâExpand the **Step Id** to see at least one of the following details request id, request type, failure reason and status message.
   * Affected requestsâExpand the **Request target** you'll see request target address, request id, request type and failure reasons.
   * Affected locations.
   * Date of first failed execution.

## Limitations

There are certain limitations when using network availability monitors. You can find out more about them below.

### Number of requests

The maximum number of network activities executed per network availability monitor is 1,000. Network activity is a single DNS request, single TCP request, or single ICMP packet. Dynatrace may use multiple packets within a single ICMP request, if configured.

If a monitor uses a [target filter](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/network-availability-monitors/create-a-nam-monitor#target-filter "Learn how to set up a NAM monitor to check the performance and availability of your site."), it might not be possible to precisely predict the number of requests in advance of execution (for example, when monitoring an entire host group or a subnet with a wide IP range). In such cases, the limit is applied when the target filter is resolved before the monitor's execution into the actual list of addresses.

The number of requests depends on the number of hosts matching the filter. For example, when monitoring an entire host group or **filtering the monitored hosts** using a subnet with a wide IP range.

### Number of monitors

You can have up to 5,000 NAM monitors per environment. Other types of monitors don't contribute to this limit.

### Deployment type

Network availability monitors are supported only on [private Synthetic locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring.").

Containerized locations

Network availability monitors are supported on [containerized](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/containerized-locations#nam-monitors-on-containerized-locations "Deploy and manage containerized, auto-scalable private Synthetic locations on Kubernetes/RedHat OpenShift.") Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate deployments, but additional permissions are required for ICMP tests.

To enable ICMP request type for NAM execution

1. In Dynatrace Hub ![Hub](https://dt-cdn.net/images/hub-512-82db3c583e.png "Hub"), search for **Settings**.
2. In **Settings**, select and expand **Web and mobile monitoring**.
3. In the **Web and mobile monitoring** section, select **Private Synthetic Locations**.
4. Select **Add Kubernetes location**.
5. Configure your location and make sure to turn on **Enable ICMP request type for Network Availability Monitors execution**.

ICMP monitors use the `ping` executable, which requires the `CAP_NET_RAW` capability set for the container executing the requests (`synthetic-vuc`). Additionally, the `allowPrivilegeEscalation` property of `securityContext` for this container has to be set to `true`, because the process that launches the `ping` executable doesn't have the required privileges set by default.

The entire `securityContext` for the `synthetic-vuc` container with enabled network availability monitors should look as follows.

```
securityContext:



readOnlyRootFilesystem: true



privileged: false



allowPrivilegeEscalation: true



runAsNonRoot: true



capabilities:



drop: ["all"]



add: ["NET_RAW"]
```

### Use of proxy

Network availability monitors do not support the use of [proxy servers](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/setting-up-proxy-for-private-synthetic#proxy-connection-scenarios "Learn how to configure ActiveGate properties to set up a proxy for private synthetic monitoring."). Ensure that your network configuration allows direct access to the monitored endpoints without routing through a proxy.

# Containerized, auto-scalable private Synthetic locations on Kubernetes

# Containerized, auto-scalable private Synthetic locations on Kubernetes

* How-to guide
* 26-min read
* Updated on Oct 22, 2025

Dynatrace version 1.264+

**Containerized, auto-scalable private Synthetic locations on Kubernetes and its commercial distribution OpenShift** are an alternative to deploying Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates on separate hosts or virtual machines and then assigning them to private locations for the execution of synthetic monitors.

Unlike individual Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates that are deployed and assigned to private locations (and then tracked via utilization metrics) **containerized locations are deployed as a whole**, with a minimum and maximum number of ActiveGates as the necessary input parameters.

Kubernetes and OpenShift aren't just additional supported ActiveGate platforms along with Windows and Linux; with this offering, containerized private Synthetic locations:

* Are auto-scalable (based on utilization metrics and the maximum/minimum number of ActiveGates specified).

* Are easy to manage and maintain.
* Support the synthetic monitoring of cloud-native solutions that require container-based application development.
* Can be deployed faster while minimizing downtime.
* Are automatically tracked for resource utilization as a part of auto-scaling operations.

You can execute scheduled as well as [on-demand](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/on-demand-executions "Execute synthetic monitors on demand from public or private locations") executions of all [types of synthetic monitors](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/types-of-synthetic-monitors "Learn about Dynatrace synthetic monitor types.") on containerized locations.

You can manage Kubernetes/OpenShift locations via the Dynatrace web UI and the existing [Synthetic - Locations, nodes, and configuration API v2](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/synthetic-v2/synthetic-locations-v2 "Manage synthetic locations via the Synthetic v2 API."). Additional Early Adopter endpoints in this API facilitate the deployment of Kubernetes locations; the new endpoints help you generate the commands that need to be executed on the Kubernetes cluster.

## Architecture

Containerized private Synthetic locations are deployed as a whole.

* Each location has multiple Synthetic-enabled **ActiveGates** configured as **pods**. You specify a minimum and maximum number of ActiveGates when [setting up a location](#initial-setup).
* The **StatefulSet** is considered as the **location**.

  You can have one or more locations per namespace. See [Requirements](#requirements) and [Recommendations and caveats](#recommend) below.

  You can have one or more auto-scalable locations per Kubernetes cluster.

Locations are scaled automatically by adjusting the number of ActiveGates per location by the following additional parts of the containerized location architecture.

* The **Synthetic metric adapter** requests and receives [utilization metrics](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/manage-private-synthetic-locations#location-details "Analyze and manage capacity usage at your private Synthetic locations.") for the containerized ActiveGates from the Dynatrace Cluster.

  There is one Synthetic metric adapter per Kubernetes cluster.

  The metric adapter is configured to communicate with a single Dynatrace environment.

  Installing a Synthetic metric adapter requires [super-user roles in Kubernetesï»¿](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#user-facing-roles)âsee [Install a containerized location](#install) below.
* The **horizontal pod auto-scaler** scales a location by adjusting the number of ActiveGates based on the utilization data it receives from the Synthetic metric adapter.

  There is one horizontal pod auto-scaler per location.

![Containerized locations for synthetic monitoring](https://dt-cdn.net/images/k8s-synthetic-locations-1769-41775c85f2.jpg)

## Requirements

Containerized private Synthetic locations are supported with Dynatrace version 1.264+ on **Kubernetes 1.22â1.25** with persistent volume and `kubectl` support.

* Additional support for **Kubernetes 1.26+** is available in the [installation workflow](#install).
* All kinds of Kubernetes implementations are supported, whether cloud or local (for example, Amazon EKS or Minikube).
* OpenShift versions compatible with the supported Kubernetes versions are supported.

Internet connectivity is required to access the public repositories where Docker images for the Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate and Synthetic metric adapter are available. These image locations are referenced in the respective template filesâsee [Install a containerized location](#install) and [Update a containerized location](#update) below.

### Sizing guide

The **ActiveGate hardware requirements** below are listed by size.

* CPU and RAM requests refer to the resources reserved by pods upon creation.
* CPU and RAM limits refer to the maximum resource consumption per pod.
* If the location is monitored by [OneAgent](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-oneagent/oa-requirements "OneAgent code module requirements") or another deep monitoring solution, memory (RAM) requirements will increase.
* Browserless pod in FIPS mode has the same requirements as ordinary browserless pod.

### Best practices and caveats

**ActiveGates**

* We recommend the **S** ActiveGate size and a minimum of two ActiveGates per location.
* When considering node size, keep in mind the possible limitations specific to the Kubernetes service you will be relying on.
* All ActiveGates within a location are always the same size.
* Once specified, ActiveGate size for a location can't be changed because persistent storage can't be resized.
* Kubernetes locations follow the same rules as other locations in that an ActiveGate can't be added to multiple locations simultaneously.
* You cannot combine containerized and non-containerized ActiveGates in the same location.
* The image for Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate is in a public registry; this image location is referenced by the template file.

**Locations**

* We recommend installing each location in its own namespace.
* If deploying more than one location per namespace, use different names for the respective ActiveGate resourcesâsee [Install a containerized location](#install) below.
* Locations that share a single Kubernetes namespace must be connected to the same Dynatrace environment as the Synthetic metric adapter in order to be auto-scalable. For example, assume that Location A and the metric adapter are configured for Environment X. However, Location A shares a namespace with Location B, which is configured for Environment Y. In such a case, Location A is auto-scalable; Location B is not auto-scalable.
* If you want to install a location in the same namespace as other Dynatrace resources such as [Dynatrace Operator](/docs/ingest-from/setup-on-k8s/guides/deployment-and-configuration/resource-management/dto-resource-limits "Set resource limits for Dynatrace Operator components."), be aware of the more demanding [hardware and system requirements](#requirements) for containerized Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates.

**Synthetic metric adapter**

* The best practice is to deploy the Synthetic metric adapter in its own namespace per Kubernetes cluster. The Synthetic metric adapter can share a namespace with a location. However, deploying the metric adapter in its own namespace ensures that it isn't deleted when a location is taken down.
* The metric adapter can only communicate with a single Dynatrace environment, so location auto-scaling works just for that environment.
* The image for the Synthetic metric adapter is in a public registry; this image location is referenced by the template file.

### Auto-scaling specifics

For auto-scaling purposes, the Synthetic metric adapter needs access to and extends the Kubernetes API by specifying a new API serviceâ`v1beta1.external.metrics.k8s.io`.

This API service is defined in the Synthetic metric adapter templateâsee <#install> below.

API service definition in the metric adapter template

```
apiVersion: apiregistration.k8s.io/v1



kind: APIService



metadata:



name: v1beta1.external.metrics.k8s.io



spec:



service:



name: dynatrace-metrics-apiserver



namespace: {{adapterNamespace}}



group: external.metrics.k8s.io



version: v1beta1



insecureSkipTLSVerify: true



groupPriorityMinimum: 100



versionPriority: 100
```

The Synthetic metric adapter also modifies an existing resource in its templateâthe `horizontal-pod-autoscaler` ServiceAccount in `kube-system` namespace.

Existing resource modification in the metric adapter template

```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1



kind: ClusterRoleBinding



metadata:



name: hpa-controller-dynatrace-metrics



roleRef:



apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io



kind: ClusterRole



name: dynatrace-metrics-server-resources



subjects:



- kind: ServiceAccount



name: horizontal-pod-autoscaler



namespace: kube-system
```

#### Limitations

Note that only one external metric server is allowed in the Kubernetes cluster. Because of this, other components that serve as a metric server (such as the KEDA add-on or the Prometheus adapter) cannot be used along with the Synthetic metric adapter.

## Install a containerized location

You can install a containerized location only in the previous Dynatrace. In the latest Dynatrace, the containerized locations are available only in view mode.

Set up and manage a containerized location in the Dynatrace web UI at **Settings** > **Web and Mobile monitoring** > **Private Synthetic locations**.

### 1. Initial setup for a Kubernetes/OpenShift location

1. Select **Add Kubernetes location** or **Add OpenShift location** on the **Private Synthetic locations** page.
2. Provide a **Location name** of your choice.
3. Select a **Geographic location**, for example, `San Francisco, California, United States`. (Note that you cannot **Save changes** until you've specified a name and location.)
4. In the **ActiveGates** section:

   1. Specify a **Minimum** and **Maximum number of ActiveGates** for your location. These settings are the auto-scaling parameters that the [horizontal pod auto-scaler](#architecture) uses.
   2. Select an ActiveGate **Node size** (`XS`, `S`, or `M`). See also [Requirements](#requirements) and [Best practices and caveats](#recommend).
   3. The **Deployment platform** is preselected based on your selection of Kubernetes or OpenShift.
5. Kubernetes only If your Kubernetes implementation is based on a later release than 1.21â1.25, turn on **Use Kubernetes version 1.26+**. See also [Requirements](#requirements) and [Best practices and caveats](#recommend).

   If you change this setting after downloading the location template, you need to repeat the deployment procedure.
6. Optional You can turn off support for browser monitors. If you do so, the ActiveGate node will be treated as [browserless](#browserless).
7. Optional Turn on [problem generation if all ActiveGates go offline](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/manage-private-synthetic-locations#outage-handling "Analyze and manage capacity usage at your private Synthetic locations.").
8. **Save changes** before proceeding with deploying the [location](#deploy-location) and [metric adapter](#deploy-adapter).

Your named location is displayed on the **Private Synthetic locations** page with the Kubernetes or OpenShift logo. Note that no ActiveGates are assigned to the location at this point.

![Empty location](https://dt-cdn.net/images/containerized-empty-location-1351-ef0b3700e2.png)

### 2. Deploy the location

Select your location in **Private Synthetic locations** to download the location template and generate the commands that need to be executed on the Kubernetes cluster.

1. In the **Deployment** section, create a **PaaS token** (**Create token**) or paste an existing token. The PaaS token is required to generate ActiveGate connection tokens for communication with your Dynatrace environment.

   Existing tokens are listed on the **Access tokens** page. Note that a PaaS token is only displayed once upon creation, after which it's stored encrypted and can't be revealed. We recommend storing your PaaS token in a password manager so that you can reuse it for creating additional private locations within your Kubernetes cluster.
2. Provide an **ActiveGate name** or use the default. This name is used as the prefix for ActiveGates deployed as part of the location. The first ActiveGate is named `<prefix>-0`, the second ActiveGate `<prefix>-1`, and so on. This name is also used as the StatefulSet name.
3. Provide a **Location namespace** name or use the default. (Leave the **Metric adapter namespace** as is. This field is only necessary for generating the [template for the Synthetic metric adapter](#deploy-adapter).)

   The **Download synthetic.yaml** button is enabled after you provide a PaaS token, ActiveGate name, and location namespace name.

   The values of fields in the **Deployment** section are not persistent. If you navigate away from the page, you need to re-enter the values.

   ![Required fields for the location template](https://dt-cdn.net/images/k8s-location-tokens-namespace-1242-d9a86d7dce.png)
4. Select **Download synthetic.yaml**. This is the location template file. You can rename the file to match your location for easy identification.
5. Copy the downloaded location template over to your Kubernetes cluster.
6. Copy and execute the generated commands on your Kubernetes cluster. Your PaaS token is automatically appended to the commands displayed.

   Execute the commands from the same location as the template file.

   If you've renamed the template file, use the new filename in the commands.

   ![Commands to create the location namespace](https://dt-cdn.net/images/k8s-location-commands-1106-4b8fac8db7.png)
7. Optional Run the following command to list all pods in a given namespace (`dynatrace` in the sample below) and verify their deployment.

   ```
   kubectl get pod -n dynatrace
   ```

   You can also view pods on the **Deployment Status** > **ActiveGates** page by filtering with the key-value pairs `Running in container: True` and `With modules: Synthetic`.

   ![ActiveGate deployment status filters](https://dt-cdn.net/images/k8s-location-deployment-status-1109-28df0f6a0c.png)

### 3. Deploy the Synthetic metric adapter

This procedure generates a separate template for the Synthetic metric adapter. You then execute generated commands on your Kubernetes cluster to deploy the metric adapter.

* You need to deploy the Synthetic metric adapter just once per Kubernetes cluster.
* Installing a Synthetic metric adapter requires a [Kubernetes super-user roleï»¿](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#user-facing-roles) to create ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings.

1. In the **Deployment** section, create a **Metrics token** (**Create token**) or paste an existing token. The metric token is an [access token](/docs/manage/identity-access-management/access-tokens-and-oauth-clients/access-tokens "Learn the concept of an access token and its scopes.") for fetching utilization data from Dynatrace. Existing tokens are listed on the **Access tokens** page.
2. Provide a **Metric adapter namespace** name or use the default. (Leave the **Location namespace** and **ActiveGate name** as is. These fields are only necessary for generating the [template for the location](#deploy-location).)

   The **Download synthetic-adapter.yaml** button is enabled after you provide a metric token and metric adapter namespace name.

   The values of fields in the **Deployment** section are not persistent. If you navigate away from the page, you need to re-enter the values.

   ![Required fields for the adapter template](https://dt-cdn.net/images/k8s-location-tokens-adapter-1213-fc6df4117a.png)
3. Select **Download synthetic-adapter.yaml**. This is the template file for the Synthetic metric adapter.
4. Copy the downloaded metric adapter template over to your Kubernetes cluster.
5. Copy and execute the generated commands on your Kubernetes cluster. Your metric token is automatically appended to the commands displayed.

   Execute the commands from the same location as the template file.

   If you've renamed the template file, use the new filename in the commands.

   ![Commands to create the metric adapter namespace](https://dt-cdn.net/images/k8s-location-adapter-commands-1167-f2c11204cc.png)

## Install FIPS-enabled containerized location

1. Set location to FIPS mode

   Currently this is only possible using the [REST API](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/synthetic-v2/synthetic-locations-v2 "Manage synthetic locations via the Synthetic v2 API."), by setting the `fipsMode` property in the request JSON.

   * To create a new location, use a [POST location](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/synthetic-v2/synthetic-locations-v2/post-a-location "Create a private synthetic location via the Synthetic v2 API.") call
   * To update an existing location, use a [PUT location](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/synthetic-v2/synthetic-locations-v2/put-a-location "Update a private synthetic location via the Synthetic v2 API.") call
2. Perform additional configuration

   Browser-supporting

   Browser-supporting with corporate proxy

   Browserless

   Provide a certificate for re-signing HTTPS requests (explained in [FIPS mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/setting-up-proxy-for-private-synthetic#fips-proxy "Learn how to configure ActiveGate properties to set up a proxy for private synthetic monitoring.")):

   ```
   kubectl -n $NAMESPACE create secret tls synthetic-fips-proxy-cert --cert=squid.crt --key=squid.key
   ```

   1. Provide a certificate for re-signing HTTPS requests (explained in [FIPS mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/setting-up-proxy-for-private-synthetic#fips-proxy "Learn how to configure ActiveGate properties to set up a proxy for private synthetic monitoring.")):

      ```
      kubectl -n $NAMESPACE create secret tls synthetic-fips-proxy-cert --cert=squid.crt --key=squid.key
      ```
   2. Provide configuration of corporate proxy to Squid (explained in [FIPS mode with corporate proxy](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/setting-up-proxy-for-private-synthetic#fips-corporate-proxy "Learn how to configure ActiveGate properties to set up a proxy for private synthetic monitoring.")):

      ```
      kubectl -n $NAMESPACE create secret generic synthetic-fips-proxy-peer --from-literal='peer.conf=cache_peer proxy.example.com parent 443 0 default no-digest proxy-only login=proxyuser:proxypass tls tls-min-version=1.2 tls-options=NO_SSLv3'
      ```
   3. Provide configuration of corporate proxy to ActiveGate:

      * see [Proxy configuration](#proxy)

   No additional configuration is needed.
3. Continue to download and deploy the YAML template as described in the [Installation](#deploy-location) section.

## Update a containerized location or its ActiveGates

You can update a containerized location or its ActiveGates only in the previous Dynatrace. In the latest Dynatrace, the containerized locations are available only in view mode.

Any updates to a location require that you download the location template file again and apply the changes via kubectl.

**To update ActiveGate versions**

1. Download the location template file.

   1. Select your location in **Private Synthetic locations**.
   2. In the **Deployment** section, re-enter the **PaaS token**, **ActiveGate name**, and **Location namespace** name that you provided during [location deployment](#deploy-location). The **Download synthetic.yaml** button is then enabled.
   3. Select **Download synthetic.yml** to download a new location template file.
   4. Rename the file to match your location for easy identification.
   5. Copy the template file over to your Kubernetes cluster.
2. Execute the following command to apply the changes on your Kubernetes cluster. Be sure to use your location template filename in place of `synthetic.yaml`. Execute this command from the same location as the template file.

   ```
   kubectl apply -f ./synthetic.yaml
   ```

Any update redeploys ActiveGates in the reverse order of their deployment. For example, if your location contains the ActiveGates `activegate-name-0` and `activegate-name-1`, `activegate-name-1` is stopped and redeployed first.

The redeployed ActiveGate pod uses the same persistent volume deployed for log continuity.

## Delete a location or metric adapter on Kubernetes

The snippets for deleting a location or a metric adapter on Kubernetes can be generated only in the previous Dynatrace.

The commands generated when [deploying a location](#deploy-location) and [the Synthetic metric adapter](#deploy-adapter) also include code snippets for deleting them on Kubernetes. You may copy and store these commands for future reference.

At any point, you can regenerate the commands for the respective namespaces.

* If you've renamed a template file, use the new filename in the commands.
* The cleanup commands shown below don't delete the respective namespaces.

**Location**

1. Select your location in **Private Synthetic locations**.
2. Re-enter the **Paas token**, **ActiveGate name**, and **Location namespace** name.
3. **Copy** and use the location **Cleanup** commands.

   ![Delete location resources](https://dt-cdn.net/images/k8s-location-delete-1111-8927775af1.png)

Note that this procedure only deletes Kubernetes resources; it doesn't delete the [location you initially set up in Dynatrace](#initial-setup).

**Synthetic metric adapter**

1. Select your location in **Private Synthetic locations**.
2. Re-enter the **Metrics token** and **Metric adapter namespace** name.
3. **Copy** and use the metric adapter **Cleanup** command.

   ![Delete the metric adapter](https://dt-cdn.net/images/k8s-location-adapter-delete-1098-fe02e0d2db.png)

If the [Synthetic metric adapter](#deploy-adapter) is deleted or stops working, horizontal pod auto-scalers can no longer receive utilization data from Dynatrace, and your containerized locations become [non-scalable](#non-scalable).

## Multi-AZ PVC access on cloud clusters

Using a multi-availability zone (multi-AZ) cluster with deployments utilizing PVC can result in pods being stuck in a pending state upon recreation. This happens because the storage volumes like EBS are not replicated between zones.

PVC is only shared between nodes located in the same availability zone. When you use a multi-AZ cluster and a node tries to access PVC from a different availability zone, it will become stuck in pending state and display an error message.

Currently, there are two possible solutions for multi-AZ Kubernetes deployments:

* Use node affinity to limit pods to a specific zone
* Use shared storage systems like EFS

### Use node affinity to limit pods to a specific zone

You can configure node affinities to use only specific zones for a deployment.

To set node affinity

1. Use the following command to find the zone each node is deployed on:

   ```
   kubectl get nodes --show-labels
   ```
2. Look for a label `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone`, for example, `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone=us-east-1a`.
3. Use the kubectl label command to set a custom label for a node:

   ```
   kubectl label nodes node name label=value
   ```

   Example

   ```
   kubectl label nodes ip-10-179-202-73.ec2.internal zone=us-east-1a
   ```
4. Add the custom node label to the `nodeSelector` section of the Synthetic deployment template. For example:

   ```
   spec:



   nodeSelector:



   zone: us-east-1a
   ```
5. Save your changes.
6. Apply the template.

Nodes with the same zone label will be deployed in the same availability zone and you'll be able to share PVC between them without causing an error.

### Use shared storage systems

Each cloud service provides its own shared storage systems options. To explain how to use shared storage systems, we will use AWS EFS as the example. For information about storage systems used by other cloud storage providers, see:

* Google Cloud: [About Filestore support for Google Kubernetes Engineï»¿](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/filestore-for-gke)
* Azure Storage: [What is Azure Files?ï»¿](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-introduction)

  The standard SMB/CIFS driver is not supported for Azure Files. For details, see [Pod crashes when modifying file permissions when backed by Azure Files storageï»¿](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7078656).

We assume that you already have EFS that you can use. If you don't, see [Getting started with Amazon EFSï»¿](https://dt-url.net/vq02epe) to learn how to set up EFS.

Be aware that EFS may be more expensive than EBS. Check pricing.

To use storage class with EFS

1. Complete the Synthetic deployment template similar to the example below:

   ```
   kind: StorageClass



   apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1



   metadata:



   name: efs-test



   provisioner: efs.csi.aws.com



   parameters:



   fileSystemId: fs-0c155dcd8425aa39d



   provisioningMode: efs-ap



   directoryPerms: "700"



   basePath: "/"
   ```
2. Modify the **volumeClaimTemplates** section of the template similar to the example below:

   ```
   volumeClaimTemplates:



   - metadata:



   name: persistent-storage



   spec:



   storageClassName: efs-test



   accessModes:



   - ReadWriteMany



   resources:



   requests:



   storage: 3Gi
   ```
3. Save your changes.
4. Apply the template.

Now, if the pod is redeployed on a node in a different zone, the PVC should be automatically bound to the new deployment zone.

## NAM monitors on containerized locations

Network availability monitors are supported on containerized Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate deployments, but additional permissions are required for ICMP tests.

To enable ICMP request type for NAM execution

1. In Dynatrace Hub ![Hub](https://dt-cdn.net/images/hub-512-82db3c583e.png "Hub"), search for **Settings**.
2. In **Settings**, search for **Private Synthetic Locations** and select it.
3. Select **Add Kubernetes location**.
4. Configure your location and make sure to turn on **Enable ICMP request type for Network Availability Monitors execution**.

* ICMP monitors use the `ping` executable, which requires the `CAP_NET_RAW` capability set for the container executing the requests (`synthetic-vuc`).
* The `allowPrivilegeEscalation` property of `securityContext` for this container has to be set to `true`, because the process that launches the `ping` executable doesn't have the required privileges set by default.

The entire `securityContext` for the `synthetic-vuc` container with enabled network availability monitors should look as follows.

```
securityContext:



readOnlyRootFilesystem: true



privileged: false



allowPrivilegeEscalation: true



runAsNonRoot: true



capabilities:



drop: ["all"]



add: ["NET_RAW"]
```

### OpenShift

OpenShift uses Security Context Constraint for limiting capabilities used by the pods.
By default, deployed pods will use the `restricted-v2` SCC, which does not allow any additional capabilities.
The recommended solution is to prepare a custom Security Context Constraint.

1. Create a dedicated Service Account Optional

   * If the custom SCC is used just by the synthetic deployment, it's recommended to create a dedicated Service Account.

     ```
     oc -n $NAMESPACE create sa sa-dt-synthetic



     oc -n $NAMESPACE adm policy add-role-to-user edit system:serviceaccount:$NAMESPACE:sa-dt-synthetic
     ```
2. Create a custom Security Context Constraint

   * scc-dt-synthetic.yaml

### Azure RedHat OpenShift (ARO)

If the OpenShift cluster is deployed as an Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) resource, by default, the Network Security Group won't allow ICMP traffic outside the cluster.

The AROs Network Security Group is not modifiable, but a custom NSG can be created and imported during the ARO cluster creation.
To learn more about it, see [Bring your own Network Security Group (NSG) to an Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) clusterï»¿](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/openshift/howto-bring-nsg).

Running the cluster with default settings will only allow for using ICMP NAM monitors for resources inside the OpenShift cluster. Any requests going outside the cluster will fail.

## Proxy configuration

Add the following code at the top of your [location template file](#deploy-location) to insert a ConfigMap resource containing your proxy server information.

In the code sample below:

* The proxy server is used for connections to the Dynatrace Cluster and tested resources.
* The namespace (`namespace: dynatrace`) must be the location namespace.

```
kind: ConfigMap



apiVersion: v1



data:



custom.properties: |-



[http.client]



proxy-server = 10.102.43.210



proxy-port = 3128



proxy-user = proxyuser



proxy-password = proxypass



metadata:



name: ag-custom-configmap



namespace: dynatrace



---
```

Add the following code at `spec.template.spec.volumes:`.

```
- name: ag-custom-volume



configMap:



name: ag-custom-configmap



items:



- key: custom.properties



path: custom.properties
```

Add the following code to the ActiveGate container configuration under `volumeMounts:`.

```
- name: ag-custom-volume



mountPath: /var/lib/dynatrace/gateway/config_template/custom.properties



subPath: custom.properties
```

## Browserless private Synthetic locations

In general, we recommend the deployment of complete synthetic private locations to support the execution of all types synthetic monitors (HTTP, browser, NAM).

If you don't need to execute browser monitors, however, you might want to consider deploying your private location in a special browserless mode. Such a location (or ActiveGate belonging to it) will be deployed without the browser. The resulting deployment requires less hardware resources, but browser monitors cannot be executed from such a location.

Consider browserless locations as an alternative to synthetic private locations with browser monitor support when youâre focused purely on:

* Network and infrastructure use cases (using NAM monitors)
* API monitoring (using HTTP monitors)

Compared to the regular template, following changes are introduced:

1. `browser` value is set for `DT_SYNTHETIC_UNSUPPORTED_MONITORING_MODULES` environment variable in `synthetic-vuc` container under `env:`

   ```
   - name: DT_SYNTHETIC_UNSUPPORTED_MONITORING_MODULES



   value: "browser"
   ```
2. No `synthetic-vuc-worker` containers are included
3. No `chromium-cache` volume is specified or mounted

## Kerberos authentication configuration

Add the following code at the top of your [location template file](#deploy-location) to insert a ConfigMap resource containing your Kerberos server information.

In the code sample below:

* The `EXAMPLE.COM` realm is used in Kerberos authentication.
* The `example.com` domain is used in Kerberos authentication.
* The `kerberos.example.com` is the hostname of Key Distribution Center.
* The namespace (`namespace: dynatrace`) must be the location namespace.

```
kind: ConfigMap



apiVersion: v1



data:



krb5.conf: |-



[libdefaults]



dns_lookup_realm = false



ticket_lifetime = 24h



renew_lifetime = 7d



forwardable = true



rdns = false



pkinit_anchors = FILE:/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt



spake_preauth_groups = edwards25519



dns_canonicalize_hostname = fallback

EXAMPLE.COM = {



kdc = kerberos.example.com



admin_server = kerberos.example.com



}



[domain_realm]



.example.com = EXAMPLE.COM



example.com = EXAMPLE.COM



metadata:



name: krb-map



namespace: dynatrace



---
```

Add the following code at `spec.template.spec.volumes:`.

```
- name: krb5-conf



configMap:



name: krb-map



items:



- key: krb5.conf



path: krb5.conf
```

Add the following code to every `synthetic-vuc-worker` container configuration under `volumeMounts:`.

```
- name: krb5-conf



mountPath: /etc/krb5.conf



subPath: krb5.conf
```

## Synthetic metric adapter

### Disable domain certificate validation

Add the following code to Synthetic metric adapter template under `env:`

```
- name: TLS_SECURE



value: "false"
```

This disables certificate validation for the Synthetic metric adapter connection to the Dynatrace Cluster (by default, it is enabled).

### Proxy configuration

Add the following code to Synthetic metric adapter template under `env:`

```
- name: HTTPS_PROXY



value: "http://proxyuser:proxypass@10.102.43.210:3128"



- name: NO_PROXY



value: "172.20.0.0/16"  # do not proxy internal calls to Kubernetes cluster
```

For more details about these environment variables see [Go httpproxy package documentationï»¿](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/net/http/httpproxy#Config).

The way of obtaining Service CIDR depends on Kubernetes distribution, for example for AWS EKS the following command can be used:

```
aws eks describe-cluster --name my-cluster --query 'cluster.kubernetesNetworkConfig'
```

## Non-scalable containerized locations

Auto-scalable locations become non-scalable for any of the following reasons.

* The location reaches its maximum number of pods in the StatefulSet, and location utilization is over the threshold of 80%. No new ActiveGate pods are created until the maximum number of ActiveGates is increased.
* The [Synthetic metric adapter](#deploy-adapter) stops working, and the location horizontal pod auto-scalers don't receive the metrics required for auto-scaling.

  You can run the following command to verify the state of a pod auto-scaler. In the example below, `dynatrace` is the location namespace.

  ```
  kubectl describe hpa -n dynatrace
  ```

  If `ScalingActive` is set to `False` in the output, the auto-scaler isn't receiving metric data.

## API: Synthetic - Locations, nodes, and configuration API v2

You can automate the deployment of and manage containerized locations via the existing [Synthetic - Locations, nodes, and configuration API v2](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/synthetic-v2/synthetic-locations-v2 "Manage synthetic locations via the Synthetic v2 API."). Early Adopter endpoints added to this API to facilitate the deployment of Kubernetes locations. The new endpoints help generate the commands you need to execute on the Kubernetes cluster.

![New endpoints for Kubernetes location deployment](https://dt-cdn.net/images/k8s-locations-endpoints-3168-a8f5b7f158.png)

* The GET location YAML endpoint (`/synthetic/locations/{LocationId}/yaml`) fetches the [location template file](#deploy-location) based on the location ID of the [location you initially set up](#initial-setup) for containerized deployment.
* The GET apply commands endpoint (`synthetic/locations/commands/apply`) fetches the list of commands to [deploy a location](#deploy-location) on Kubernetes/Openshift.
* The GET delete commands endpoint (`synthetic/locations/{LocationId}/commands/delete`)fetches the commands to delete a containerized location.

# Create a private Synthetic location

# Create a private Synthetic location

* How-to guide
* 24-min read
* Updated on Jan 12, 2026

You can run your Dynatrace synthetic monitors from a private Synthetic location, which is a location in your private network infrastructure where you install one or more Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate instances.

With monitors executed from a private location, you can bring the testing capabilities available in public locations right into your own environment. With private locations you can:

* Measure internal webpage performance and availability.
* Measure complex internal applications with browser clickpaths.
* Measure external resources with synthetic monitors run from internal locations.
* Monitor APIs, both internal and external.

Private Synthetic locations support all [types of Dynatrace synthetic monitors](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/types-of-synthetic-monitors "Learn about Dynatrace synthetic monitor types.").

## System and hardware requirements for private locations

Make sure the target host you plan to use for running synthetic monitors complies with [system and hardware requirements for private Synthetic locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/system-and-hardware-requirements-for-private-synthetic "Supported operating systems, Chromium versions, and hardware requirements for running synthetic monitors from private locations"). Note that Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates have more demanding hardware and system requirements than a regular Environment or Cluster ActiveGate.

Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate installed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and 22.04 LTS only You can use [`TEMP`](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/installation/linux/linux-customize-installation-for-activegate#temporary "Learn about the command-line parameters that you can use with ActiveGate on Linux.") to customize the [default temporary directory for private Synthetic files](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/configuration/where-can-i-find-activegate-files#default-activegate-directories--linux "Find out where ActiveGate files are stored on Windows and Linux systems.")â`/var/tmp/dynatrace/synthetic`. However, the path must begin with `/var/tmp`, for example, `TEMP=/var/tmp/syn`. Dynatrace requires write access to `/var/tmp` for the installation of Chromium snap packages.

End-of-support information

* There are no new versions of Chromium for Red Hat/Oracle Linux/Rocky Linux 8 beyond version 133.
  For important security and stability reasons, we've decided to discontinue our support for installing **Synthetic-enabled** ActiveGate on Red Hat/Oracle Linux/Rocky Linux 8 after ActiveGate version 1.325.
  ActiveGate version 1.325 is **the last Synthetic-enabled** ActiveGate supported on Red Hat/Oracle Linux/Rocky Linux 8.
  Additionally, with Dynatrace version 1.326, we plan to introduce mechanisms preventing Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates on Red Hat/Oracle Linux/Rocky Linux 8 from being updated beyond version 1.325.
* Chromium development for Amazon Linux 2 stopped at version 126.
  For important security and stability reasons, we've decided to discontinue our support for installing Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate on Amazon Linux 2 after ActiveGate version 1.307.
  ActiveGate version 1.307 is the last Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate to support Amazon Linux 2.
  Additionally, with Dynatrace version 1.308, we have introduced mechanisms preventing Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates on Amazon Linux 2 from being updated beyond version 1.307.
* Chromium development for Red Hat/CentOS 7 stopped at version 126.
  For important security and stability reasons, we've decided to discontinue our support for installing Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate on Red Hat/CentOS 7 after ActiveGate version 1.305.
  ActiveGate version 1.305 is the last Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate to support Red Hat/CentOS 7.
  Additionally, with Dynatrace version 1.306, we have introduced mechanisms preventing Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates on Red Hat/CentOS 7 from being updated beyond version 1.305.

  + Since Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 reached [End of Maintenanceï»¿](https://dt-url.net/af03uea) support on June 30, 2024, all of its packages have been archived. This means that it may not be possible to find the required dependencies for update. For more details, see the [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 statusï»¿](https://dt-url.net/e623zr1)

### Before you begin

* You cannot execute synthetic monitors using an Environment ActiveGate configured for [multi-environment support](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/configuration/configure-an-environment-activegate-for-multi-environment-support "Read the step-by-step procedure for configuring a single Environment ActiveGate for multi-environment support.").
* You can create a private location using a clean-installed Synthetic-enabled Environment ActiveGate version 1.169+ or Cluster ActiveGate with Dynatrace Managed version 1.176+. If you want to use an existing ActiveGate host, [uninstall ActiveGate](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/operation/uninstall-activegate "Learn how to remove ActiveGate from Windows or Linux-based systems.") first.
* Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate is used exclusively to run synthetic monitors. A clean ActiveGate installation for the purpose of synthetic monitoring disables all other ActiveGate features, including communication with OneAgents.
* Make sure that the ActiveGate can connect to other [Dynatrace components](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/supported-connectivity-schemes-for-activegates "Learn about the connectivity priorities between ActiveGate types as well as the priorities between ActiveGates and OneAgents.") as well as the resource you want to test. See [Set up a proxy for private synthetic monitoring](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/setting-up-proxy-for-private-synthetic "Learn how to configure ActiveGate properties to set up a proxy for private synthetic monitoring.").
* Only **IPv4** and **DNS UDP** are supported for network configuration.
* Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate needs access to the **Amazon S3** service to upload and access browser monitor screenshots from private locations. Ensure that your firewall configuration allows connections to `*.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com` on port `443`. You can also [set up your proxy](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/setting-up-proxy-for-private-synthetic "Learn how to configure ActiveGate properties to set up a proxy for private synthetic monitoring.") to connect to the Amazon S3 service. (Screenshots are stored in a different folder for each monitoring environment, but the S3 Bucket is the same (`ruxit-synth-screencap`). Data is encrypted by [Amazon S3-managed keyï»¿](https://dt-url.net/4a02xvx).)
* Both manual and automatic Chromium updates require access to `https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com`. For security reasons, public access to the S3 bucket is enabled only for specific files; trying anything else will result in a 403 error.

## Install a Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate

Install an ActiveGate in latest Dynatrace

The instructions below describe how to install an ActiveGate in the previous Dynatrace. To learn how to install an ActiveGate in the latest Dynatrace, see [Private synthetic locations on Grail](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations#create-a-private-location "Learn how to manage private locations in the Synthetic app.").

Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate is used exclusively to run synthetic monitors. A clean ActiveGate installation for the purpose of synthetic monitoring disables all other ActiveGate features, including communication with OneAgents. Make sure the host on which you install the ActiveGate has access to the internet.

Manual installation

If this web UI-guided installation fails, or you prefer to prepare the host for the Synthetic engine yourself, you can [manually install Chromium and other dependencies via S3](#manual). You can also [install Chromium from a custom, local repository](#custom-repo).

1. For Environment ActiveGate, in Dynatrace Hub, select **ActiveGate** > **Set up**.

   For Cluster ActiveGate, go to the Dynatrace Cluster Management Console and select **More** ![More](https://dt-cdn.net/images/more-icon-01c8b008ca.svg "More") > **Add new Cluster ActiveGate**.
2. Select the operating system to view instructions.
3. Create a [**PaaS Token**](/docs/manage/identity-access-management/access-tokens-and-oauth-clients/access-tokens "Learn the concept of an access token and its scopes.") or enter an existing token. This token has the **Download OneAgent and ActiveGate installers** `InstallerDownload` token scope, which allows you to download the ActiveGate installer. Once provided, the token is automatically appended to download and installation commands, which are then displayed in the UI.

   You can find existing tokens listed on the **Access tokens** page. Note that a PaaS token is only displayed once upon creation, after which it's stored encrypted and cannot be revealed. We recommend that you store a PaaS token after creation in a password manager so that you can reuse it as needed.
4. Linux only For **Choose installer type**, keep the default selection: `x86/64`.
5. For **What's the purpose of this ActiveGate**, select **Run synthetic monitors from a private location**.
6. Optional Assign the ActiveGate to a private Synthetic locationâselect a location from the dropdown list. You can also [assign the ActiveGate to a location](#add) after installation.
7. Optional You can turn off support for browser monitors. If you do so, the Synthetic ActiveGate will be treated as [browserless](#browserless).

   ![Disabling support for browser monitors](https://dt-cdn.net/images/browserless-deploy-415-1d20a6159c.png)
8. Optional **Set customized options** to assign the ActiveGate to a [**Network zone**](/docs/manage/network-zones "Find out how network zones work in Dynatrace.") and [**ActiveGate group**](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/activegate-group "Understand the basic concepts of ActiveGate groups.").
9. Download the installer to the target host.
10. Linux only Recommended **Verify signature**ârun the displayed command on the target host to download a certificate file and verify the installer.
11. Linux only Select a Linux distribution.
12. Run the installer and any other commandsâmake sure you use the exact commands displayed in the UI.

    Linux only The installer automatically downloads Chromium and the dependencies required by the Synthetic engine. On Red Hat, Oracle Linux, and Rocky Linux you also need to enable repositories from which the installer downloads the dependencies. As a prerequisite for enabling proprietary repositories on Red Hat, you need to register your Red Hat instance. The web UI provides you with all the required commands for doing so, as shown in the example below.

    ![Commands to install ActiveGate on Red Hat 9](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synth-ag-commands-red-hat-9-2025-11-17-723-eef29810b5.png)
13. Verify the ActiveGate installation (**Show deployment status**).

## Add a private location

Add a private location in latest Dynatrace

The instructions below describe how to add a private location in previous Dynatrace. To learn how to add a private location in latest Dynatrace, see [Private synthetic locations on Grail](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations#create-a-private-location "Learn how to manage private locations in the Synthetic app.").

1. Search for and select **Settings**. Then select **Web & mobile monitoring** > **Private synthetic locations**.
2. Select **Create location**.
3. Give your location a custom **Name**, for example `Boston office, 3rd floor`.
4. Map it from an existing geographic location or add a custom geographic location defined by **Country**, **Region**, **City**, and **Geographic coordinates**.
5. Add a Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate to the location. Note that an ActiveGate can only be assigned to a single location.

   You can also leave the location temporarily unassigned and assign it during the [ActiveGate installation process](#install).
6. Select **Add**.
7. Select **Save**.

## Create a synthetic monitor

Now, when you create your HTTP or browser monitor, select the location you've just created from the list of all available locations. For more information, see [Create an HTTP monitor](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/create-an-http-monitor-classic "Learn how to set up an HTTP monitor to check the performance and availability of your site."), [Create a single-URL browser monitor](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/create-a-single-url-browser-monitor "Learn how to set up a single-URL browser monitor to check the availability of your site."), or [Record a browser clickpath](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/record-a-browser-clickpath "Learn how to record a browser clickpath to monitor the availability and performance of your application.").

## Linux only Install Chromium and dependencies manually from S3

This section is not relevant for Browserless locations.

Amazon Linux 2023, Ubuntu 24, and Oracle Linux 9

Amazon Linux 2023, Ubuntu 24, and Oracle Linux 9 use Chrome for Testing instead of Chromium. For manual installation of Chrome for Testing on these operating systems, see [Amazon Linux 2023, Ubuntu 24, and Oracle Linux 9 (Chrome for Testing)](#chrome-for-testing).

If the [web UI-guided installation](#install) fails or you prefer to prepare the host for the Synthetic engine yourself, you can install Chromium and other dependencies using the procedure below. Ensure that you can connect to `https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com` to access Chromium and dependencies. For security reasons, public access to the S3 bucket is enabled only for specific files; trying anything else will result in a 403 error.

Also see [Install Chromium from a custom repository](#custom-repo) below.

See [how to update Chromium manually](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/manage-private-synthetic-locations#chromium-manual "Analyze and manage capacity usage at your private Synthetic locations.") in [Manage private Synthetic locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/manage-private-synthetic-locations "Analyze and manage capacity usage at your private Synthetic locations."). We strongly recommend that you keep your Linux-based Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates and Chromium versions updatedâDynatrace supports Chromium versions that are no more than two versions behind the [latest Dynatrace-supported version](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/system-and-hardware-requirements-for-private-synthetic#chromium-linux "Supported operating systems, Chromium versions, and hardware requirements for running synthetic monitors from private locations") for a specific ActiveGate release.

### Ubuntu Server

1. Install Synthetic engine dependencies:

   Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04

   Synthetic engine dependencies:

   ```
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install xvfb x11-xkb-utils xfonts-100dpi xfonts-75dpi xfonts-scalable libnss3-tools auditd
   ```

   Chromium dependencies:

     curl --output chromium.tgz https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/Chromium/snap/chromium-129.0.6668.89-2965.tgz
     ```

     You can [verify the authenticity of the packages](#verify) using the signature files stored together with the package archives.
   * Extract the installation packages. Go to the directory where you saved the archive and run the following command:

     ```
     mkdir /tmp/chromium ; tar xzf chromium.tgz -C /tmp/chromium
     ```

     This creates a `/tmp/chromium` directory and extracts the packages into it.
   * Install the extracted packages.

     Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04

     ```
     sudo chown -R root:root /tmp/snap-private-tmp
     ```

     ```
     sudo snap ack /tmp/chromium/chromium.assert
     ```

     ```
     sudo snap install --devmode /tmp/chromium/chromium.snap
     ```

     Substitute `dtuserag` with the names of the ActiveGate service user and group if they differ from the default values.

     ```
     sudo chown -R dtuserag:dtuserag /tmp/snap-private-tmp
     ```

     This installs all the packages extracted to the `/tmp/chromium/` directory. You can delete the `/tmp/chromium/` directory and the downloaded `chromium.tgz` archive after successful Chromium installation.
3. After you satisfy the dependencies, run the ActiveGate installer with root rights with the `--enable-synthetic` parameter set to `manual`. For example:

   ```
   /bin/bash ./Dynatrace-ActiveGate-Linux.sh --enable-synthetic=manual
   ```

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Oracle Linux, and Rocky Linux

* Chromium development for Red Hat/CentOS 7 and Amazon Linux 2 stopped at version 126.

  + Since Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 reached [End of Maintenanceï»¿](https://dt-url.net/af03uea) support on June 30, 2024, all of its packages have been archived. This means that it may not be possible to find the required dependencies for update. For more details, see the [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 statusï»¿](https://dt-url.net/e623zr1)
* Chromium installation when a proxy is required for internet access.

  + If you need to download and install Chromium, and your system requires a proxy for internet access, you should configure `curl`to use the correct proxy. Specify your proxy and port details by running the commands as in this example:

    ```
    vi /root/.curlrc



    proxy=http://proxy.example.com:8080
    ```

     ```

     You can [verify the authenticity of the packages](#verify) using the signature files stored together with the package archives.
   * Extract the installation packages. Go to the directory where you saved the archive and run the following command:

     ```
     mkdir /tmp/chromium ; tar xzf chromium.tgz -C /tmp/chromium
     ```

     This creates a `/tmp/chromium` directory and extract the packages into it.
   * Install extracted packages.

     ```
     sudo yum install -y /tmp/chromium/*.rpm
     ```

     This installs all the packages extracted to the `/tmp/chromium/` directory. You can delete the `/tmp/chromium/` directory and the downloaded `chromium.tgz` archive after successful Chromium installation.
3. Disable automatic update of Chromium packages:

   ```
   sudo yum -y install yum-plugin-versionlock



   sudo yum versionlock chromium



   sudo yum versionlock chromium-common
   ```
4. Optional Install non-Latin TrueType fonts:

   ```
   sudo yum install dejavu-fonts-common.noarch dejavu-sans-fonts.noarch
   ```
5. After you satisfy the dependencies, run the ActiveGate installer with root rights with the `--enable-synthetic` parameter set to `manual`. For example:

   ```
   /bin/bash ./Dynatrace-ActiveGate-Linux.sh --enable-synthetic=manual
   ```

### Amazon Linux 2023, Ubuntu 24, and Oracle Linux 9 (Chrome for Testing)

Unlike Chromium on other distributions, Chrome for Testing updates do not use package managers. You manually manage the Chrome binaries while dependencies are managed by the system package manager.

See [how to update Chrome for Testing manually](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/manage-private-synthetic-locations#chromium-manual "Analyze and manage capacity usage at your private Synthetic locations.") in [Manage private Synthetic locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/manage-private-synthetic-locations "Analyze and manage capacity usage at your private Synthetic locations."). We strongly recommend that you keep your Linux-based Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates and Chrome for Testing versions updatedâDynatrace supports Chrome for Testing versions that are no more than two versions behind the [latest Dynatrace-supported version](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/system-and-hardware-requirements-for-private-synthetic#chromium-linux "Supported operating systems, Chromium versions, and hardware requirements for running synthetic monitors from private locations") for a specific ActiveGate release.

1. Set up repositories and install dependencies.

   Ubuntu 24

   Amazon Linux 2023

   Oracle Linux 9

   * Install Synthetic engine dependencies:

     ```
     sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install xvfb x11-xkb-utils xfonts-100dpi xfonts-75dpi xfonts-scalable libnss3-tools auditd unzip
     ```
   * Install Chrome for Testing dependencies:

     ```
     sudo apt-get -y install libasound2t64 libatk-bridge2.0-0t64 libatk1.0-0t64 libcairo2 libcups2t64 libgbm1 libnspr4 libnss3 libpango-1.0-0 libxcomposite1 libxdamage1 libxfixes3 libxkbcommon0 libxrandr2
     ```

   * Enable `EPEL` (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux):

     ```
     sudo yum install -y epel-release
     ```
   * Install Synthetic engine dependencies:

     ```
     sudo yum install -y xorg-x11-server-Xvfb xorg-x11-xkb-utils xorg-x11-server-utils xorg-x11-fonts-100dpi xorg-x11-fonts-75dpi xorg-x11-fonts-Type1 libwayland-server mesa-libgbm curl nss-tools unzip
     ```
   * Install Chrome for Testing dependencies:

     ```
     sudo yum install -y alsa-lib at-spi2-atk atk cairo cups-libs dbus-libs libXcomposite libXdamage libXrandr libxkbcommon mesa-libgbm nspr nss pango
     ```

   * Enable `EPEL` (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux):

     ```
     sudo yum install -y oracle-epel-release-el9
     ```
   * Install Synthetic engine dependencies:

     ```
     sudo yum install -y xorg-x11-server-Xvfb xkbcomp xorg-x11-server-utils xorg-x11-fonts-100dpi xorg-x11-fonts-75dpi xorg-x11-fonts-Type1 libwayland-server mesa-libgbm curl nss-tools unzip
     ```
   * Install Chrome for Testing dependencies:

     ```
     sudo yum install -y alsa-lib at-spi2-atk atk cairo cups-libs libXcomposite libXdamage libXrandr libxkbcommon mesa-libgbm nspr nss pango
     ```
2. Download and set up Chrome for Testing.

   * Create the Chrome for Testing directory:

     ```
     sudo mkdir -p /usr/lib/chrome_for_testing
     ```
   * Download the Chrome for Testing package archive to a temporary location. This is a safe and verified archive hosted by Dynatrace.

     ActiveGate version 1.329

     ```
     curl --output /tmp/chrome.zip https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/Chrome/chrome-for-testing-linux64/chrome-for-testing-linux64-142.0.7444.175.zip
     ```

     ActiveGate version 1.327

     ```
     curl --output /tmp/chrome.zip https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/Chrome/chrome-for-testing-linux64/chrome-for-testing-linux64-141.0.7390.122.zip
     ```

     You can [verify the authenticity of the packages](#verify) using the signature files stored together with the package archives.
   * Extract the installation package and clean up:

     ```
     sudo unzip /tmp/chrome.zip -d /usr/lib/chrome_for_testing



     rm /tmp/chrome.zip
     ```

     This creates a `chrome-linux64` directory inside `/usr/lib/chrome_for_testing` and extracts the Chrome binary and supporting files into it.
   * Verify Chrome for Testing by checking the version:

     ```
     /usr/lib/chrome_for_testing/chrome-linux64/chrome --version
     ```

     Command output should show the Chrome version you downloaded.
3. After you satisfy the dependencies, run the ActiveGate installer with root rights. The installer will automatically detect and validate Chrome for Testing. For example:

   ```
   /bin/bash ./Dynatrace-ActiveGate-Linux.sh --enable-synthetic=manual
   ```

   Custom Chrome for Testing directory: If you want to use a different directory than the default `/usr/lib/chrome_for_testing`, specify it by setting the `synthetic_chrome_for_testing_path` property in the `custom.properties` file after installation. The new directory will be used after the upgrade of Synthetic module.

   Chrome for Testing files are preserved during ActiveGate uninstallation. If you uninstall the ActiveGate, the Chrome for Testing directory and its contents will remain on the system and can be reused during reinstallation.

## Linux only Install Chromium from a custom repository

ActiveGate version 1.243+ In addition to [web UI-guided ActiveGate installation](#install) and [manual installation of Chromium and dependencies](#manual), you can also **install ActiveGate by pointing to a custom, local repository for Chromium components**. As this repository is an HTTP server that you set up within your network, the advantage of this method is that it can be used in environments with intranet-only or limited network access.

This method of installing Chromium broadly consists of:

* Downloading the required Dynatrace-hosted deb, snap, or rpm package archives and their corresponding signature files.
* Installing and running a locally hosted web server where the downloaded Chromium components reside.
* Downloading and running the ActiveGate installer on the target host with an environment variable pointing to the location of the custom repository on the HTTP server.

* A custom Chromium repository can be used only for Chromium components, not their dependencies. Installing Chromium from a custom repository will only work if all dependencies have been resolved before installation.
* Custom repositories can only be used for **Chromium installation and autoupdate**âsee [Chromium autoupdate from a custom repository in Manage private Synthetic locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/manage-private-synthetic-locations#autoupdate-custom-repo "Analyze and manage capacity usage at your private Synthetic locations.") for details.

1. Download the Chromium componentsâthe package archive and signature fileâfrom the safe and verified archive hosted by Dynatrace. See [Requirements for private Synthetic locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/system-and-hardware-requirements-for-private-synthetic "Supported operating systems, Chromium versions, and hardware requirements for running synthetic monitors from private locations") for links to the latest supported and provided Chromium versions.

   We recommend keeping your Linux-based Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates and Chromium versions up to date; choose the latest provided Chromium version for ActiveGate.

   For example, for ActiveGate version 1.255 on Ubuntu 22. the required files are:

   * Package archiveâ`https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/Chromium/snap/chromium-107.0.5304.87-2168.tgz`
   * Signature fileâ`https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/Chromium/snap/chromium-107.0.5304.87-2168.tgz.sig`

   The corresponding download commands are:

   ```
   curl -o chromium-107.0.5304.87-2168.tgz https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/Chromium/snap/chromium-107.0.5304.87-2168.tgz
   ```

   ```
   curl -o chromium-107.0.5304.87-2168.tgz.sig https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/Chromium/snap/chromium-107.0.5304.87-2168.tgz.sig
   ```
2. Install a web server of your choice and create a directory, for example, `chromium-repo`, to serve the Chromium components to the ActiveGate host. Copy the downloaded Chromium components to this directory.
3. Download the ActiveGate installer from Dynatrace Hub.
4. Resolve all dependencies and enable repositories as required as shown in [Install Chromium and dependencies manually from S3](#manual) above. The custom repository can be used only for Chromium packages, not their dependencies.
5. Install the ActiveGate with the Synthetic module enabled (`--enable-synthetic`) and the `DYNATRACE_SYNTHETIC_CUSTOM_CHROMIUM_REPO` environment variable pointing to the location of the custom repository (`https://172.18.0.100/chromium-repo` in this example).

   ```
   sudo DYNATRACE_SYNTHETIC_CUSTOM_CHROMIUM_REPO=http://172.18.0.100:8000/chromium-repo  /bin/bash Dynatrace-ActiveGate-Linux-x86-1.257.0.20221129-155835.sh --enable-synthetic
   ```

   You can use the hostname of the HTTP server instead of the IP address so long as the ActiveGate host can resolve the hostname.

Once you've installed Chromium in this way from a custom repository, it can only be autoupdated. See [Chromium autoupdate from a custom repository in Manage private Synthetic locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/manage-private-synthetic-locations#autoupdate-custom-repo "Analyze and manage capacity usage at your private Synthetic locations.") for details and update alternatives.

## Custom Chromium version

You can install a custom Chromium version, that is, override the Chromium version that the ActiveGate installer looks for. This is applicable for manual ActiveGate installation, as described in [Chromium installation via S3](#manual) or via a [custom repository](#custom-repo).

In this command for manual ActiveGate installation via S3, an environment variable points to an explicit Chromium version number `107.0.5304.87-2168`, which is part of the package archive for Ubuntu 20 or 22.

```
sudo /bin/bash -c "export DYNATRACE_SYNTHETIC_EXPLICIT_CHROMIUM_VERSION=107.0.5304.87-2168; /bin/bash Dynatrace-ActiveGate-Linux-x86-1.257.0.20221129-155835.sh --enable-synthetic"
```

This command searches for the Chromium version `107.0.5304.87-2168` in the custom repository `https://172.18.0.100/chromium-repo`.

```
sudo DYNATRACE_SYNTHETIC_EXPLICIT_CHROMIUM_VERSION=107.0.5304.87-2168 DYNATRACE_SYNTHETIC_CUSTOM_CHROMIUM_REPO=http://172.18.0.100:8000/chromium-repo  /bin/bash Dynatrace-ActiveGate-Linux-x86-1.257.0.20221129-155835.sh --enable-synthetic
```

## Browserless Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate

In general, we recommend the deployment of Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate to support the execution of all types synthetic monitors (HTTP, browser, NAM).

If you don't need to execute browser monitors, however, you might want to consider deploying your node in a special browserless mode. Such a node will be deployed without the browser. The resulting deployment requires less hardware resources, but browser monitors cannot be executed from such a node.

Consider browserless nodes as an alternative to nodes with browser monitor support when you're focused purely on:

* Network and infrastructure use cases (using NAM monitors)
* API monitoring (using HTTP monitors)

## Kerberos client setup

If you want to run Browser Monitor tests using Kerberos authentication, the private location should be configured to be able to get ticket from the Kerberos Key Distribution Center.

Windows

Linux

1. Each Windows machine using Kerberos has to be properly configured with Active Directory.
2. If you are unable to authenticate with Kerberos on Windows, use the following command to register the machine.

```
ksetup /addkdc DOMAIN.TO.ADD address.of.kerberos.server
```

The `DOMAIN.TO.ADD` is your domain name and `address.of.kerberos.server` is the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (Active Directory Controller if you're using a Microsoft solution). Note that in the credentials used, the domain name must be in uppercase (for example, user@EXAMPLE.COM).

Synthetic uses Kerberos authentication by executing the `kinit` command. For details, see [MIT Kerberos Documentation - kinitï»¿](https://dt-url.net/pr43wj6).

A Linux private location has to be properly configured to be able to get a ticket from the Kerberos Key Distribution Center. Make sure that the location has the following:

* Installed packages for Kerberos client (workstation).
* Properly configured `/etc/krb5.conf` file (or configuration file specified by `KRB5_CONFIG` environment variable).

The configuration is dependent on the Linux distribution. You can find more information in the official documentation.

* Ubuntu:

  + `sudo apt install krb5-user`
  + More information: [Ubuntu Server Documentation - How to set up basic workstation authenticationï»¿](https://dt-url.net/3g03w9p)
* Red Hat/Rocky:

  + `yum install krb5-workstation krb5-libs`
  + More information: [Red Hat Documentation - Configuring a Kerberos Clientï»¿](https://dt-url.net/1u23wq7)

## Synthetic FIPS compliance

ActiveGate version 1.315+

### Installation

To install Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate in FIPS compliant mode you need to add `--fips-mode` flag, see also [customize ActiveGate installation for FIPS compliance](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/installation/linux/linux-customize-installation-for-activegate#fips-compliant-mode "Learn about the command-line parameters that you can use with ActiveGate on Linux.").

```
/bin/bash ./Dynatrace-ActiveGate-Linux.sh --enable-synthetic --fips-mode
```

Please note that FIPS-compliant mode cannot be changed after installation. To change the mode, you need to uninstall ActiveGate and reinstall it with the desired settings.
Additionally, if you intend to execute browser monitors additional setup will be required as described in [Proxy configuration for FIPS mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/setting-up-proxy-for-private-synthetic#fips-proxy "Learn how to configure ActiveGate properties to set up a proxy for private synthetic monitoring.") and [Proxy configuration for FIPS mode with corporate proxy](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/setting-up-proxy-for-private-synthetic#fips-corporate-proxy "Learn how to configure ActiveGate properties to set up a proxy for private synthetic monitoring.")

### Requirements and limitations

* We require operating system with FIPS-compliant mode enabled, see also [ActiveGate FIPS compliance](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/activegate-fips-compliance "Learn about ActiveGate FIPS compliance").
* Following operating systems are currently supported:

  + Ubuntu Pro 22.04
  + Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9
* Private Synthetic locations on Kubernetes are not supported at the moment.

### Ensuring compliance

To ensure the browser monitor traffic is FIPS compliant, it must be routed through a local intercepting proxy that encrypts traffic with a FIPS-certified crypto library. See [Proxy configuration for FIPS mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/setting-up-proxy-for-private-synthetic#fips-proxy "Learn how to configure ActiveGate properties to set up a proxy for private synthetic monitoring.") for details.

For HTTP monitors, we use the [Amazon Corretto Crypto Providerï»¿](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider/) FIPS-certified cryptographic library that uses AWS-LC-FIPS 2.x as its cryptographic module. See [Certificate #4816ï»¿](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/4816).

Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate in FIPS compliant mode supports the same set of cipher suites as [regular ActiveGate](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/activegate-fips-compliance#supported-cipher-suites "Learn about ActiveGate FIPS compliance").

## FAQ

How can I verify the authenticity of downloaded Chrome(-ium) packages?

Chromium

Chrome for Testing

Each `tgz` package archive is stored in the S3 bucket together with the `*.tgz.sig` signature file. To verify if the packages on your drive are authentic Dynatrace-provided archives:

1. Download the signature file. The filename is identical to the package archive but has the `sig` filename extension. For example, for Chromium 140, the command is:

   ```
   curl --output chromium.tgz.sig https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/Chromium/rpm/chromium-140.0.7339.185-1.el9.tgz.sig
   ```
2. Verify the package:

   ```
   wget https://ca.dynatrace.com/dt-root.cert.pem ; openssl cms



   -verify



   -in chromium.tgz.sig



   -inform PEM



   -content chromium.tgz



   -binary



   -CAfile dt-root.cert.pem > /dev/null
   ```
3. Verify the signature timestamp.

   You can also get the exact timestamp of a signature. Download the `*.tgz.sig.tsr` file from the same location as installation packages and signature and run the following command:

   ```
   openssl ts -reply -in chromium.tgz.sig.tsr -text
   ```

Each `zip` package archive is stored in the S3 bucket together with the `*.zip.sig` signature file. To verify if the packages on your drive are authentic Dynatrace-provided archives:

1. Download the signature file. The filename is identical to the package archive but has the `sig` filename extension. For example, for Chrome for Testing 141.0.7390.122, the command is:

   ```
   curl --output chrome.zip.sig https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/Chrome/chrome-for-testing-linux64/chrome-for-testing-linux64-141.0.7390.122.zip.sig
   ```
2. Verify the package:

   ```
   wget https://ca.dynatrace.com/dt-root.cert.pem ; openssl cms



   -verify



   -in chrome.zip.sig



   -inform PEM



   -content chrome.zip



   -binary



   -CAfile dt-root.cert.pem > /dev/null
   ```
3. Verify the signature timestamp.

   You can also get the exact timestamp of a signature. Download the `*.zip.sig.tsr` file from the same location as installation packages and signature and run the following command:

   ```
   openssl ts -reply -in chrome.zip.sig.tsr -text
   ```

Can I use a proxy with the Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate?

With ActiveGate version 1.175+, an ActiveGate executing synthetic monitors can connect through the proxy to both the Dynatrace Cluster and the tested resource. For more information, see [Setting up proxy for private synthetic monitoring](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/setting-up-proxy-for-private-synthetic "Learn how to configure ActiveGate properties to set up a proxy for private synthetic monitoring.").

Can I update an earlier ActiveGate to version 1.169+ and configure it to use with private synthetic monitors?

No, you need to run a clean installation specifically for the purpose of synthetic monitoring to enable your ActiveGate to execute monitors from private locations.

Can I turn on Synthetic on an existing ActiveGate installation?

Private Synthetic locations require a clean installation of ActiveGate specifically for the purpose of synthetic monitoring.

Manually editing the `custom.properties` file is not enough to enable the ActiveGate to execute synthetic monitors.

# Manage private Synthetic locations

# Manage private Synthetic locations

* How-to guide
* 10-min read
* Updated on Oct 23, 2025

[Add a private Synthetic location](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location#add "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring.") as well as analyze and manage capacity usage in the **Private synthetic locations** global settings page (select the **Private synthetic locations** settings page from search results).

Early Adopter

Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate version 1.217+

Dynatrace version 1.218+

## Overall location status

The colorized overall location status is displayed only in the previous Dynatrace.

Private Synthetic locations in your environment are listed with green, yellow, red, or gray indicators of overall capacity usage status. You can see the type and number of synthetic monitors as well as the number of Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates assigned to each location.

Select the monitor type (**HTTP** or **Browser**) to see the list of synthetic monitors of that type at that location.

You can select multiple locations for bulk management of [outage handling](#outage-handling). Select the checkbox next to each location you want to manage.

![Private Synthetic location settings](https://dt-cdn.net/images/pvtsyntheticlocations-1400-8d3260f571.png)

The colored status indicator for each location shows if it's overloaded in terms of capacity usage, enabling you to make educated decisions about adding more ActiveGates to run additional monitors. (Also check [system and hardware requirements for private Synthetic locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/system-and-hardware-requirements-for-private-synthetic "Supported operating systems, Chromium versions, and hardware requirements for running synthetic monitors from private locations").)

For usage calculations on each ActiveGate, Dynatrace allocates CPU and RAM resources for running each type of monitor. Resource allocation per monitor type is resolved into the maximum number of simultaneous monitor executions that may take place at any given point in time. Actual capacity usage calculation per monitor type (see [Location details](#location-details) below) is based on the number of concurrently executed monitors compared to the maximum allowed simultaneous executions over the preceding 30 minutes.

For example, an ActiveGate might support two simultaneous browser monitor executions at a given point. However, depending on the duration of the monitors being executed, this could equate to more than two monitors being executed within a given timeframe. For example, one 55-second monitor and three 10-second monitors could be executed within a single minute with no more than two simultaneous executions at any given point.

Metrics for capacity usage per monitor type provide an accurate view of Synthetic location health and can be used for charting and alertingâbe sure to split these metrics by location (see [Location details](#location-details) below).

Status icon

Description

![Green circle](https://dt-cdn.net/images/green-96ff8e506c.svg "Green circle")

The capacity usage of each type of synthetic monitor is below 80%, which is desirable.

![Yellow circle](https://dt-cdn.net/images/yellow-379afa433f.svg "Yellow circle")

This icon can mean any of the following:

* The capacity usage of a least one type of synthetic monitor is more than 80%.
* There is no failover because:

  + Failure of any ActiveGate or [Synthetic engine](/docs/manage/credential-vault#security-arch "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.") can cause usage requirements to exceed maximum capacity.
  + There is only one ActiveGate assigned to the location.

![Red circle](https://dt-cdn.net/images/red-a092f67573.svg "Red circle")

* Capacity usage of at least one type of synthetic monitor at this location is greater than 90%. Or, not all synthetic monitors assigned to this location are being executed. Note that some monitor executions may be dropped when there are spikes in capacity usage for a monitor type, for example, when multiple monitors are updated at the same time.
* This icon is also displayed when all ActiveGates or all Synthetic engines at the location are down.

If a location is down or a Synthetic engine/ActiveGate is offline, synthetic monitors assigned to that location won't be executed.

![Grey circle](https://dt-cdn.net/images/grey-870accb943.svg "Grey circle")

There is no data, as when ActiveGate versions are lower than 1.217 and capacity usage data cannot be gathered.

## Location details

Location details in latest Dynatrace

The instructions below describe how to view location details in the previous Dynatrace. To learn how to view location details in the latest Dynatrace, see [Private synthetic locations on Grail](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations#location-details "Learn how to manage private locations in the Synthetic app.").

Select a location to see the breakdown of its overall status into capacity usage per monitor type. For each of these monitor types, you can see the number of monitors and hourly scheduled executions as well as the capacity use percentage.

* HTTP monitors
* High-resource HTTP monitors
* Browser monitors
* Network Availability monitors

You can't see usage data per monitor type when all ActiveGates or Synthetic engines at a location are down.

The ActiveGates assigned to the location are listed and displayed in red when a Synthetic engine or an ActiveGate itself is offline; the **Status** column shows a corresponding message. You can add or delete ActiveGates from here. Note that the **Add ActiveGate** button is disabled when no ActiveGates are available to be assigned to a locationâyou can check for this in **Deployment Status**.

![Private location details in previous Dynatrace](https://dt-cdn.net/images/screenshot-2025-10-22-171901-1356-64e2b3b050.png)

Metrics for the health status of each monitor type are available for charting and alerting. For example, choose the **Synthetic - Browser - Engine Utilization** metric in the [Metrics browser](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/dashboards-classic/metrics-browser "Browse metrics with the Dynatrace metrics browser.") or [Data Explorer](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/explorer "Query for metrics and transform results to gain desired insights."). We strongly recommend splitting these metrics by location to get an accurate view of location health.

![Synthetic monitors metrics in Data Explorer Classic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/screenshot-2025-10-22-174729-1400-717532af10.png)

### Chromium autoupdate

You can **Enable Chromium auto-update** at the location level, that is, for all ActiveGates assigned to a private location. Chromium autoupdate takes place during manual as well as automatic ActiveGate and Synthetic engine updates.

As we recommend using the [latest supported Chromium version](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/system-and-hardware-requirements-for-private-synthetic#chromium-linux "Supported operating systems, Chromium versions, and hardware requirements for running synthetic monitors from private locations") for the smooth and secure execution of browser monitors from your private location, Chromium autoupdate is turned on by default for locations with Linux-based ActiveGates. If you don't want Chromium to be updated automatically, for example, to use a specific version of Chromium, or if you have offline environments, turn off the switch **before triggering an ActiveGate update**.

This setting only applies to Linux-based ActiveGates; on Windows-based ActiveGates, Chromium is always updated during Synthetic engine updates. If your location has only Windows-based ActiveGates, the toggle is turned on but grayed out.

Successful Chromium autoupdate requires access to OS (system) repositories for Chromium dependencies and access to `https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com` for Chromium components. If you've enabled a [custom local repository](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location#custom-repo "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring."), Chromium components (but not dependencies) need to be available at the specified HTTP server address. See [Chromium autoupdate from a custom repository](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/manage-private-synthetic-locations#autoupdate-custom-repo "Analyze and manage capacity usage at your private Synthetic locations.").

You will see a message if Chromium autoupdate fails for this or other reasonsâwe recommend either meeting the requirements for autoupdate (such as access to repositories) or disabling Chromium autoupdate for your private location.

* We strongly recommend that you keep your Linux-based Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates and Chromium versions updatedâDynatrace supports Chromium versions that are no more than two versions behind the [latest Dynatrace-supported version](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/system-and-hardware-requirements-for-private-synthetic#chromium-linux "Supported operating systems, Chromium versions, and hardware requirements for running synthetic monitors from private locations") for a specific ActiveGate release. If you don't opt for Chromium autoupdate, you can [update Chromium manually](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/manage-private-synthetic-locations#chromium-manual "Analyze and manage capacity usage at your private Synthetic locations.").
* If you disable Chromium autoupdate, you can [manually update Chromium](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/manage-private-synthetic-locations#chromium-manual "Analyze and manage capacity usage at your private Synthetic locations.") per ActiveGate. However, Chromium autoupdate is required when using [custom repositories](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location#custom-repo "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring."). See [Chromium autoupdate from a custom repository](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/manage-private-synthetic-locations#autoupdate-custom-repo "Analyze and manage capacity usage at your private Synthetic locations.").
* Autoupdate works to update Chromium to the latest version that Dynatrace provides for an ActiveGate release. In some cases, this might be different from the [latest Dynatrace-supported Chromium version](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/system-and-hardware-requirements-for-private-synthetic#chromium-linux "Supported operating systems, Chromium versions, and hardware requirements for running synthetic monitors from private locations") for the ActiveGate release.

Also, check our information on [installing Chromium and other dependencies manually (Linux only)](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location#manual "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring.").

### Location outage handling

Location outage handling in latest Dynatrace

The instructions below describe how to handle outages in the previous Dynatrace. To learn how to handle outages in the latest Dynatrace, see [Private synthetic locations on Grail](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations#location-outage-handling "Learn how to manage private locations in the Synthetic app.").

For each location, enable the corresponding switches to generate problems when a location or any of its ActiveGates/Synthetic engines are unavailable:

* You can generate a problem when the entire location is unavailable (all assigned ActiveGates or Synthetic engines are offline).
* You can generate a problem when any single ActiveGate or Synthetic engine assigned to the location is offline.

  For example, suppose your location has two ActiveGates, and you enable both problem switches. You will see three problems when your location is unavailableâone for the entire location and one for each ActiveGate that's offline.
* Additionally, you can opt to view a banner notification at the top of the Dynatrace web UI when either the entire location or any individual ActiveGate/Synthetic engine is unavailable.

  ![Banner notification](https://dt-cdn.net/images/pvtsyntheticlocationbannernotification-1290-d2e3105395.png)

From the main settings page listing all your private Synthetic locations, you can select multiple locations for bulk management of outage handling.

1. Select the checkbox next to each location you want to manage.
2. Select **Edit** in the lower-left corner of the page.

   ![Bulk edit locations](https://dt-cdn.net/images/pvtsyntheticlocationbulkedit-1852-dcc12815fd.png)
3. Select the appropriate outage handling checkbox.
4. Enable/disable the switch below the checkbox. This will overwrite the corresponding setting for the selected locations.

   ![Bulk edit location outage handling](https://dt-cdn.net/images/pvtsyntheticlocationbulkedit2-1296-3e4a8e3646.png)
5. **Save changes**.

## Update Chromium manually from S3

You might want to update Chromium and dependencies manually if you have an offline environment. If you've installed an ActiveGate manually, say, for manual dependency management because of constraints in accessing the Amazon S3 service, you'll want to update Chromium manually.

You need to update Chromium manually per ActiveGate, and the process varies slightly based on the operating system. Note that manual update of Chromium only applies to Linux-based ActiveGates; on Windows-based ActiveGates, Chromium is automatically updated during Synthetic engine updates.

Prerequisites:

* Ensure that **Enable Chromium auto-update** is turned off for your private location in **Settings** > **Web and Mobile monitoring** > **Private Synthetic locations**. If you disable autoupdate for a location, you need to update Chromium manually on every ActiveGate assigned to that location.
* Ensure that you can connect to `https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com` to access Chromium and dependencies.

* The Synthetic engine will use the new Chromium version after the update is completeânote that the status is updated once every hour, so it may take up to an hour to refresh the Chromium version displayed for your ActiveGate in **Deployment Status**.
* We strongly recommend that you keep your Linux-based Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates and Chromium versions updatedâDynatrace supports Chromium versions that are no more than two versions behind the [latest Dynatrace-supported version](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/system-and-hardware-requirements-for-private-synthetic#chromium-linux "Supported operating systems, Chromium versions, and hardware requirements for running synthetic monitors from private locations") for a specific ActiveGate release. (See also [Chromium update](#chromium).)
* We strongly recommend updating all ActiveGates per location to the same version.
* See also [Chromium update](#chromium) and [Chromium autoupdate from a custom repository](#autoupdate-custom-repo).

Ubuntu Server

Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS

Amazon Linux 2023, Ubuntu 24, and Oracle Linux 9 (Chrome for Testing)

1. If your ActiveGate and Chromium versions haven't been updated in a while, you might want to check and install Synthetic engine and Chromium dependencies again. See the [manual installation instructions for Ubuntu Server](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location#ubuntu "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring.") in [Create a private Synthetic location](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring.").
2. Download the snap (Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04) package archive. This is a safe and verified archive hosted by Dynatrace at `https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com`. Be sure to use the specific command provided for your ActiveGate and Ubuntu Server versions in the [manual installation instructions for Ubuntu Server](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location#ubuntu "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring.").
3. Extract and install the downloaded packages. Be sure to use the correct installation command for your Ubuntu Server version (check the [manual installation instructions for Ubuntu Server](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location#ubuntu "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring.")).
4. Verify Chromium update by running the following command from the default installation directory. Command output should match the Chromium version you installed.

   ```
   /opt/dynatrace/synthetic/browser --version
   ```

Updating Chromium manually is identical on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS, the only difference being the downloaded packages for Red Hat/CentOS version 7 and version 8.

If you've installed Chromium manually, there's no need at the time of the update to register the Red Hat instance in the subscription manager or to enable the Red Hat repositories or EPEL packages.

1. If your ActiveGate and Chromium versions haven't been updated in a while, you might want to install Synthetic engine dependencies again. See the [manual installation instructions for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location#redhat "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring.") in [Create a private Synthetic location](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring.").
2. Download the rpm package archive. This is a safe and verified archive hosted by Dynatrace at `https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com`. Be sure to use the specific command provided for your ActiveGate and OS versions in the [manual installation instructions for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location#redhat "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring.").
3. Extract and install the downloaded packages. Check the [manual installation instructions for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location#redhat "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring.").
4. If necessary, disable the automatic update of Chromium packages. Note that for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS, packing locking, once performed, remains persistent across all future updates.

   ```
   sudo yum -y install yum-plugin-versionlock



   sudo yum versionlock chromium



   sudo yum versionlock chromium-common
   ```
5. Verify Chromium update by running the following command from the default installation directory. Command output should match the Chromium version you installed.

   ```
   /opt/dynatrace/synthetic/browser --version
   ```

Chrome for Testing is managed differently than Chromium. Manual updates are performed by downloading and extracting the new version to the Chrome for Testing directory.

Unlike Chromium on other distributions, Chrome for Testing updates do not use package managers. You manually manage the Chrome binaries while dependencies are managed by the system package manager.

1. If your ActiveGate and Chrome for Testing versions haven't been updated in a while, you might want to check and install Synthetic engine and Chrome for Testing dependencies again. See the [manual installation instructions for Chrome for Testing](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location#chrome-for-testing "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring.") in [Create a private Synthetic location](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring.").
2. Download the Chrome for Testing package archive to a temporary location. This is a safe and verified archive hosted by Dynatrace at `https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com`. Be sure to use the specific command provided for your ActiveGate version in the [manual installation instructions for Chrome for Testing](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location#chrome-for-testing "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring."), but modify the output path to `/tmp/chrome.zip`.
3. Remove the old Chrome for Testing directory, extract the new version, and clean up:

   ```
   sudo rm -rf /usr/lib/chrome_for_testing/chrome-linux64



   sudo unzip /tmp/chrome.zip -d /usr/lib/chrome_for_testing



   rm /tmp/chrome.zip
   ```

   If you configured a custom Chrome for Testing directory via the `synthetic_chrome_for_testing_path` property in `custom.properties`, replace `/usr/lib/chrome_for_testing` with your custom path in the commands above.
4. Verify Chrome for Testing update by running the following command. Command output should match the Chrome version you installed.

   ```
   /usr/lib/chrome_for_testing/chrome-linux64/chrome --version
   ```

   The Synthetic engine will use the new Chrome for Testing version immediately. Note that the status is updated once every hour, so it may take up to an hour to refresh the Chrome version displayed for your ActiveGate in **Deployment Status**.

## Chromium autoupdate from a custom repository

If you've enabled a [custom, local repository for Chromium installation](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location#custom-repo "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring."), Chromium can only be autoupdated. Follow this procedure to autoupdate Chromium via the same custom repository.

1. After ActiveGate installation, specify the custom repository of the ActiveGate in the [`[synthetic]` section of the `custom.properties` file](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/configuration/configure-activegate#synth_mod "Learn which ActiveGate properties you can configure based on your needs and requirements.") in the `/var/lib/dynatrace/gateway/config` directory. This allows for automatic Chromium updates from the custom repository during manual or automatic Synthetic engine updates.

   ```
   [synthetic]



   chromium_repo = https://172.18.0.100/chromium-repo
   ```
2. Turn on **Enable Chromium auto-update** for your private location in global settingsâgo to **Settings** > **Web and mobile monitoring** > **Private Synthetic locations**. Then select your location and enable the toggle in **Chromium update** section.

   Note that the Chromium autoupdate UI setting applies to all ActiveGates assigned to your private location.
3. Ensure that the Chromium components required for update are available at the custom repository location. Chromium is then automatically updated from the custom repository during ActiveGate and Synthetic engine updates.

Chromium autoupdate option

If you do not specify the custom repository in `custom.properties`, Chromium is downloaded and updated from S3 during a manual or automatic ActiveGate and Synthetic engine update.

# Requirements for private Synthetic locations

# Requirements for private Synthetic locations

* Reference
* 15-min read
* Updated on Jan 13, 2026

Ensure that the host you want to use for your private location complies with the following requirements.

End-of-support information

* There are no new versions of Chromium for Red Hat/Oracle Linux/Rocky Linux 8 beyond version 133.
  For important security and stability reasons, we've decided to discontinue our support for installing **Synthetic-enabled** ActiveGate on Red Hat/Oracle Linux/Rocky Linux 8 after ActiveGate version 1.325.
  ActiveGate version 1.325 is **the last Synthetic-enabled** ActiveGate supported on Red Hat/Oracle Linux/Rocky Linux 8.
  Additionally, with Dynatrace version 1.326, we plan to introduce mechanisms preventing Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates on Red Hat/Oracle Linux/Rocky Linux 8 from being updated beyond version 1.325.
* Chromium development for Amazon Linux 2 stopped at version 126.
  For important security and stability reasons, we've decided to discontinue our support for installing Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate on Amazon Linux 2 after ActiveGate version 1.307.
  ActiveGate version 1.307 is the last Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate to support Amazon Linux 2.
  Additionally, with Dynatrace version 1.308, we have introduced mechanisms preventing Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates on Amazon Linux 2 from being updated beyond version 1.307.
* Chromium development for Red Hat/CentOS 7 stopped at version 126.
  For important security and stability reasons, we've decided to discontinue our support for installing Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate on Red Hat/CentOS 7 after ActiveGate version 1.305.
  ActiveGate version 1.305 is the last Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate to support Red Hat/CentOS 7.
  Additionally, with Dynatrace version 1.306, we have introduced mechanisms preventing Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates on Red Hat/CentOS 7 from being updated beyond version 1.305.

  + Since Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 reached [End of Maintenanceï»¿](https://dt-url.net/af03uea) support on June 30, 2024, all of its packages have been archived. This means that it may not be possible to find the required dependencies for update. For more details, see the [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 statusï»¿](https://dt-url.net/e623zr1)
* Check the latest [ActiveGate release notes](/docs/whats-new/activegate "Release notes for Dynatrace ActiveGate") for the oldest supported ActiveGate versions.

## Operating system requirements

Antivirus and Anti-Malware software

Antivirus and anti-malware software can adversely affect Dynatrace Synthetic monitoring capabilities. The antivirus or anti-malware software might block the Chromium browser or Dynatrace processes responsible for executing synthetic monitors, cause Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate installation failures, interfere with network communication, and impact the reliability of measurements.

Please also note

To ensure proper stability and performance, consider adding the following directories and processes to the allowed list or excluding them from the policy:

**Directories:**

* All directories with `synthetic` in their path. For an overview of directories in use, see [ActiveGate directories](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/configuration/where-can-i-find-activegate-files#default-activegate-directories--windows "Find out where ActiveGate files are stored on Windows and Linux systems.").

**Processes:**

* chrome
* vucwrapper
* java

This is the minimal list of processes and directories required for Dynatrace Synthetic to operate. It's not guaranteed that the service will function correctly with only these exclusions. Collaborate with your vendor to appropriately allow expected behaviors from Dynatrace.

Prior to contacting Dynatrace support to troubleshoot issues with your private synthetic locations make sure that antivirus or anti-malware software was excluded as a source of problems.

A freshly installed ActiveGate can run your private synthetic monitors (both HTTP and browser monitors) on the following operating systems.

### Windows

#### Supported operating systems

| Windows OS | Versions |
| --- | --- |

ActiveGate version 1.307 is the last Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate to support Amazon Linux 2.

3

ActiveGate version 1.325 is the last Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate to support Red Hat/Oracle Linux/Rocky Linux 8.

#### Chromium versions on Linux

We strongly recommend that you keep your Linux-based Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates and Chromium versions updatedâDynatrace supports Chromium versions that are no more than two versions behind the latest Dynatrace-supported version for a specific ActiveGate release. For example, if the latest supported Chromium version is 103, Dynatrace supports up to Chromium version 101. If the provided Chromium version is significantly older for a specific OS, we support only the provided version. See information on updating Chromium [automatically](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/manage-private-synthetic-locations#chromium "Analyze and manage capacity usage at your private Synthetic locations.") and [manually](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/manage-private-synthetic-locations#chromium-manual "Analyze and manage capacity usage at your private Synthetic locations.").

On Linux, the ActiveGate installer downloads the Chromium dependencies that are required by the Synthetic engine. On Red Hat and Rocky, you need to enable particular repositories from which the installer downloads the dependencies. The Dynatrace web UI provides you with all the required commands. For detailed instructions, see [Create a private synthetic location](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring.").

When [installing ActiveGate and Chromium from a custom, local repository](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location#custom-repo "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring."), you need to resolve all dependencies and enable repositories as required; the custom repository can be used only for Chromium packages, not their dependencies. Place the Chromium package archive and the signature file in the custom repository for installation. If your package archive file is `https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/Chromium/snap/chromium-107.0.5304.87-2168.tgz` (Chromium 107 for Ubuntu 20 and 22 on ActiveGate version 1.255), you can find the signature file by appending `.sig` to the URL: `https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/Chromium/snap/chromium-107.0.5304.87-2168.tgz.sig`.

* Chromium development for Red Hat/CentOS 7 and Amazon Linux 2 stopped at version 126.

  + Since Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 reached [End of Maintenanceï»¿](https://dt-url.net/af03uea) support on June 30, 2024, all of its packages have been archived. This means that it may not be possible to find the required dependencies for update. For more details, see the [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 statusï»¿](https://dt-url.net/e623zr1)

Due to changes in `libdav1d.so.6` packet availability Chromium versions older than 130 cannot be installed on Red Hat/Rocky Linux 9.
Please refer to [troubleshooting guideï»¿](https://dt-url.net/x303x5f) for details.

Introduced support for Oracle Linux 9.

#### File Access Policy Daemon framework (`fapolicyd`)

If not configured correctly, the File Access Policy Daemon (`fapolicyd`) can potentially affect Dynatrace Synthetic monitoring capabilities. Similarly to antivirus or anti-malware software, `fapolicyd` might block the Chromium browser or Dynatrace processes responsible for executing synthetic monitors.

To ensure proper stability and performance, consider adding directories and processes to the allowed list or excluding them from the policy. For more detailed information, refer to the [Red Hat documentation on fapolicydï»¿](https://dt-url.net/tn1v0z1x). Prior to contacting Dynatrace support to troubleshoot issues with your private synthetic locations, make sure that `fapolicyd` was excluded as a source of problems.

File Access Policy Daemon framework can be run in debug mode where all denials are logged, making tracking down missing rules and troubleshooting issues easier. For more detailed information about its debug mode, refer to the [documentation on troubleshooting problems related to fapolicydï»¿](https://dt-url.net/e943wcc)

## Hardware requirements

### General considerations

* Note that a Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate has more demanding hardware and system requirements than a regular Environment or Cluster ActiveGate. We strongly recommend using a Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate exclusively for synthetic monitoring purposes.
* Any additional component running on the host should be taken into account when planning resources provisioning. For instance, if the location is monitored by [OneAgent](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-oneagent/oa-requirements "OneAgent code module requirements") or another deep monitoring solution, memory (RAM) requirements will increase.
* You need to uninstall and reinstall your Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate to change its size, for example, after increasing the resources of your S-sized ActiveGate to meet the requirements for a size M. Reinstallation is required before you can make use of the updated resources for synthetic monitoring; otherwise, your ActiveGate will continue to show up as size S (**Synthetic Node size**) in **Deployment Status** and will be subject to the execution limits of size S.

### Sizing guide

Based on the number of tests executed per hour, Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates need to meet the following hardware requirements.

Limit values

The estimated limits listed in the table below were determined in our internal tests. The actual values might vary depending on the complexity of your monitors.

XS node

S node

M node

L node

XS node

While XS nodes can be used on Windows Server-based ActiveGates, they may not be the best fit due to the higher hardware demands of Chromium. For optimal performance and to prepare for future enhancements, we recommend having at least 8 GB of RAM and 25 GB of free disk space.

On Linux systems with only 4 GB of RAM, the increasing resource requirements of Chrome (or Chromium), combined with the installation of third-party tools on the host, may lead to occasional memory shortages. Upgrading to 8 GB of RAM is strongly recommended to help ensure a smoother and more reliable experience.

|  | Node with browser monitor support | Browserless node |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Minimum CPUs | 2 vCPU | 1 vCPU |
| Minimum free disk space | 20 GB | 17 GB |
| Minimum RAM | 4 GB | 4 GB |
| Minimum free RAM | 3 GB | 2,7 GB |
| Minimum disk IOPS (Windows) | 100 | 100 |
| Estimated maximum number of HTTP monitor executions/h[1](#fn-4-1-def) | 300k | 300k |
| Estimated maximum number of high-resource HTTP monitor[2](#fn-4-2-def) executions/h | 10k | 10k |
| Estimated maximum number of browser monitor executions/h | 300 | - |
| Estimated maximum number of NAM ICMP monitor packets/h[3](#fn-4-3-def) [5](#fn-4-5-def) | 500k | 500k |
| Estimated maximum number of NAM TCP monitor requests/h[4](#fn-4-4-def) [6](#fn-4-6-def) | 1M | 1M |
| Estimated maximum number of NAM DNS monitor request/h[4](#fn-4-4-def) [7](#fn-4-7-def) | 100k | 100k |

Footnotes

1

Calculated as 5000 monitor executions (maximum for a single environment) run once every minute (maximum frequency).

2

These are HTTP monitors on private locations with any of: pre- or post-execution scripts, OAuth2 authorization, Kerberos authentication.

3

For NAM monitors using ICMP request type, capacity is related to number of ICMP echo requests (packets) that are being sent during monitors execution. As this number of packets-to-be-sent may significantly vary among defined monitors, using the number of monitor executions as a capacity limit would be inaccurate.

4

For NAM monitors using TCP and DNS request types, capacity is related to the number of network connections (requests) that are being sent during monitors execution. As this number of requests may significantly vary among defined monitors, using the number of monitor executions as a capacity limit would be inaccurate.

5

During load tests that helped to establish capacity limits, NAM ICMP monitors were exclusively scheduled on location; monitors had the following characteristic.

For NAM monitors using ICMP request type, capacity is related to number of ICMP echo requests (packets) that are being sent during monitors execution. As this number of packets-to-be-sent may significantly vary among defined monitors, using the number of monitor executions as a capacity limit would be inaccurate.

#### Permissions for `/tmp`

Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate requires write access to the `/tmp` directory during runtime. Its dependencies, including xvfb, utilize `/tmp` for storing temporary files and runtime data.
Lack of write permissions to this directory may result in unexpected failures or degraded functionality.
Ensure that the host environment provides sufficient access rights and available space in `/tmp` to support these operations reliably.

# Browser monitors reporting results

# Browser monitors reporting results

* Latest Dynatrace
* Reference
* 15-min read
* Updated on Jan 23, 2026

The browser monitors reporting provides:

* Preview panelâdisplays monitor execution results, problems, errors, and monitor properties. It features at-a-glance information with ready links to drill right down to problem details and edit monitor settings.
* Reporting results pageâdisplays more detailed information including result visualizations like charts and tables that show availability and performance metrics for the monitor in the selected timeframe.
* Analyze executionsâallows you to analyze individual monitor executions in detail.

To display browser monitor results

1. Go to ![Synthetic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-new-256-1ddb35ac79.png "Synthetic") **Synthetic**.
2. Optional To filter the table for browser monitors, select **Browser** under **Filter options** on the left.
3. From the list of browser monitors, select the monitor you want to examine. This displays a preview panel on the right.
4. To access the details page, select **View details** in the upper-right of the preview panel.

![Browser monitor landing page](https://dt-cdn.net/images/screenshot-2025-06-17-180713-3222-29cda17e53.png)

## Metric visualizations

The top panel shows overall monitor availability and performance for the selected timeframe.

Use the  filter bar at the top of the page to filter browser monitor executions by one or more locations.

Under the filter bar, you can see tiles for important information:

* Outage/Available/No dataâthe monitor availability status at the moment of the last executed test.
* Active issuesâthe number of issues being observed at the moment.
* Affected locationsâthe number of locations where outages happened in a specific timeframe.
* Availabilityâthe monitors availability rate in percent in a specific timeframe.
* Total downtimeâthe total outage time for all locations in a specific timeframe.
* Durationâthe average response time for all locations in a specific timeframe.

In the upper-right corner of the page, you can access [**Analyze executions**](#analyze-executions), [**On-demand execution**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/on-demand-executions "Learn about how to perform on-demand executions."), and more browser monitor settings:

* **Edit**
* for more options ( **Disable** and  **Delete**)

## Availability

The **Availability** card displays the monitor's availability for the selected timeframe, either aggregated for all locations or for each location separately. It contains information about all availability problems related to the given monitor, maintenance windows, and unfinished executions. The problems are displayed as bar-shaped [notifications over the availability chart](#notifications_over_availability_charts). They provide the problem details and mark the period when the problem occurred.

Also, if the monitor is down (unavailable) at one or more locations, the outage (downtime) duration and affected locations are displayed in the [metric visualizations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/browser-monitors-results-reporting#metric-visualizations "Learn about the Browser details page for Browser monitors.") above the **Availability** card.

A monitor can be down at one or all locations. Several downtimes may occur in a given timeframe. Their durations are summarized to calculate the total outage (downtime) duration. Overlapping downtimes are not counted.

### Availability calculation

Availability metrics are calculated by dividing the number of successful executions ("up") by the total number of executions

1. Determine the number of up executions in the timeframe.

   This is the total number of executions in the timeframe, minus the number of failed ("down") executions in the timeframe.
2. Determine availability.

   Divide the number of up executions by the total number of executions, and then multiply by 100 to get a percentage.

**Example**

Suppose we have 5 down executions in a 35-minute timeframe.

* Total executions = `35`.
* Down executions = `5`.
* Up executions = `35-5 = 30`.
* Availability = `(30/35) \* 100 = 0.8571 \* 100` = `85.71 percent`.

#### Exclude maintenance period executions from metrics calculations

You can set up a maintenance window so test executions are not suppressed during maintenance periods. Then, if outages happen during the maintenance period, down executions are included in the metrics calculations.

In the example below, the availability is less than 100% because the down executions are included in the metric calculation by default.

```
timeseries av = avg(dt.synthetic.browser.availability), by: {dt.entity.synthetic_test}



| fields dt.entity.synthetic_test, avgAV=arrayAvg(av)



| filter dt.entity.synthetic_test == "SYNTHETIC_TEST-2891B733D75330FA"
```

![Browser monitor - availability with included maintenance period executions ](https://dt-cdn.net/images/854002b6-0eec-43ce-a39f-f974e1495a83-1280-6e35ac4977.png)

To exclude the maintenance period executions from the metric calculation

1. Add the `dt.maintenance_window_ids` dimension to the query.
2. Filter the executions that are not covered by the maintenance window with `isNull(dt.maintenance_window_ids)`.

In the example below, we observed down executions during the maintenance period. However, they were not included in the calculation metric because we used the `dt.maintenance_window_ids` dimension along with the `isNull(dt.maintenance_window_ids)` filter condition.

```
timeseries av = avg(dt.synthetic.browser.availability), by: {dt.entity.synthetic_test, dt.maintenance_window_ids}



| filter dt.entity.synthetic_test == "SYNTHETIC_TEST-2891B733D75330FA"



| filter isNull(dt.maintenance_window_ids)



| fields avgAV=arrayAvg(av)
```

![Browser monitor - availability with excluded maintenance period executions](https://dt-cdn.net/images/b0e9f9cf-7bb3-4c6a-8487-7c918211ea39-1280-b5a3c8bf0c.png)

#### Interpolation

The approach described above requires all executions to happen at the same rate. However, in a real-world environment this is not always the case as the monitor execution frequency may change or additional on-demand executions may be triggered.

To make the calculation more accurate, the interpolation mechanism is introduced: the total monitoring time is divided into minute-level data points. All data points count as executions, although they don't necessarily coincide with actual executions.

To see interpolated data points, add the `interpolated` dimension to the query.

```
timeseries avg(dt.synthetic.browser.availability), by:{dt.entity.synthetic_test, interpolated}



| filter dt.entity.synthetic_test == "SYNTHETIC_TEST-7E0A1CF206C4A1C5"
```

The result below shows the blue data points that coincide with actual executions, and the white data points which don't.

![Interpolation for browser monitors](https://dt-cdn.net/images/screenshot-2025-07-15-171842-1901-8c5b65b6c4.png)

Let's imagine a monitor is set to execute tests every five minutes. So, every fifth data point (blue) coincides with an actual execution. All data points following the first down execution and preceding the first up execution count as "down". Thus, when calculating the availability metrics, the number of down executions is calculated as follows:

Down executions = the first actual down execution + all following "down" data points.

### Notifications over availability chart

Also, the **Availability** card displays notifications over the availability chart. The notifications show details of a maintenance window, outages, and not executed or finished tests. A notification is displayed as a bar above the timeframe when a maintenance window was applied, an outage occurred, or some tests were not executed or finished. Hover over the bar to see the details:

* **Browser monitor local outage**âthe outage happened in one or more locations from which the monitor executed the tests.
* **Browser monitor global outage**âthe outage happened in all locations from which the monitor executed the tests.

  Local and global outage - view problem details

  To see the details of the problem

  1. Select the bar to pin the **Browser monitor local outage** or **Browser monitor global outage** tooltip.
  2. Hover over the tooltip.
  3. Select  **View problem details**.
  4. Select one of the available options:

  + **Problems** to see the problem details in Latest Dynatrace
  + **Problems Classic** to see the problem details in Dynatrace Classic
* **Maintenance window**âa maintenance window was on in the timeframe.

  How to see the maintenance window, and what happens if the monitor execution is on/off

  To see the maintenance window

  1. Select the bar to pin the **Maintenance window** tooltip.
  2. Hover over the **Maintenance window** tooltip.
  3. Select **View maintenance window settings**.
  4. Select **Settings Classic**.

  + When the **Disable synthetic monitor execution** option is on in the maintenance window, the scheduled automatic tests are suppressed during the maintenance period so there are no tests results for this period. Only [on-demand](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/on-demand-executions "Learn about how to perform on-demand executions.") tests are not suppressed.
  + When the **Disable synthetic monitor execution** option is off in the maintenance window, the tests are executed during the maintenance period, but, due to maintenance, the test results may differ from those observed under the normal conditions.

#### Not executed or finished tests

If some tests were not executed or finished due to improper monitor configurations or some issues at Dynatrace side, you can see a reason behind it:

* **No result**âthe execution started but the results were not delivered. Reach out to the Dynatrace support team.
* **No capability**âyou're trying to execute monitors that aren't supported by a location (for example, NAM ICMP monitors - from a location with inactive ICMP).
* **Discarded, not executed**âthe probable cause is the overloaded private location. Check the capacity metrics. If there are no issues with the metrics, contact the Dynatrace support team.

## Performance

The **Performance** card displays:

* The average duration of each step across all locations (**Step performance** tab).
* The total duration of all steps for each location (**Split by location** tab).

It helps identify slow steps or regional performance issues.

### Display problems in Performance section

* Red bar above the chart indicates an ongoing problem.
* Grey bar above the chart indicates a closed problem.

Only performance problems are marked in this section.

If the monitor violates a performance threshold, whether for the total duration of all steps or for the duration of an individual step, a solid red line appears above the performance graph for the problem duration. Select the solid red bar to display a link to the problem overview page.

View problem details

1. Hover over the problem bar to see an ongoing/closed problem details in the form of a tooltip.
2. Select the problem bar and hover over the tooltip to display more options.
3. Select  **View problem details** to open the problem details in Problems ![Problems app - new](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dynatrace-davis-new-256-340162f8c6.webp "Problems app - new").

## Problems

The **Problems** card shows performance (threshold violation) and availability (local or global outage) problems.

There are three main problem types for browser monitors:

* Global outage (availability).
* Local outage (availability).
* Performance threshold violation (performance problem for sum of all steps or individual steps).

Performance problems may combine threshold violations at the monitor as well as step levels.

The problems section lists all problems in the selected timeframe, both open and closed. On top of that, you can:

* See the details of a problem in the form of a table with a start date and duration.
* Expand each problem to see affected entities and alerting profiles.

Problems, along with their constituent [events](#events) give you a full picture of the number and scope of your monitor's issues.

## Synthetic steps and actions

The **Synthetic steps and actions** card shows details for each browser step the monitor is set to perform. It can be a page loading, click on some button or any other control, etc. For each step, you can see such details as:

* **Action type**âfor example, **Click**.
* **Avg. duration**âaverage response time for a certain timeframe, for example, for the last hour.
* **Screenshot**âthe screenshot taken during the step execution.

Select the expand icon  for a step to see the response time of individual executions in a specific timeframe (for example, the last hour). It allows you to evaluate the overall step performance. The expand icon is unavailable and can't be selected if there is no performance data for the step.

## Errors

The **Errors** card displays errors found in the selected timeframe.

On the card, you can:

* See the details of an error in the form of a table with the step and number of occurrences.
* Select **Analyze errors** .

  You are directed to the **Multidimensional analysis** page in Dynatrace Classic, where you are provided with in-depth error analysis.

## Events

The **Events** card shows all events that compose problems. Events for active as well as resolved problems show up in the list and timeline.

Hover over a time slot in the event timeline to see the type and number of events generated at that interval. Select a time slot to view a tooltip with the events that took place in it.

Select an event type to see the list of events. An event is created per location where, for example, your monitor violates step- or monitor-level performance thresholds. Select an individual event to see details.

## Frontends

The **Frontends** card displays the frontends to which the monitor is assigned.

## Locations

The **Locations** card shows the status of the last monitor execution for each location. The status is displayed with colors:

* Greenâthe location was available during the last monitor execution.
* Redâan outage was detected during the last monitor execution.
* Grayâthere is no data about executions for this location.

## Properties and tags

This informational card shows the number of steps, the number and list of locations, frequency of monitor execution, and any applied tags.

Select  **Edit** to edit or apply additional tags.

## Analyze executions

When using a browser monitor, you can analyze individual monitor executions in detail.

### Analyze executions without new browser monitoring experience

Not applicable to new Dynatrace environments created after January 26, 2026.

If the new browser monitoring experience is not activated, you can analyze executions on the **Multidimensional analysis** page in Synthetic Classic.

1. Select **Analyze executions** at the top of the monitor's details page.

   You are directed to the **Multidimensional analysis** page in Dynatrace Classic.
2. In the **Detailed analysis timeframe** section, select an execution to pin its tooltip.
3. Hover over the tooltip and select **View execution**.

### Analyze executions with new browser monitoring experience

DPS License

If the new browser monitoring experience is activated, you can analyze executions via the Waterfall chart in Latest Dynatrace.

During the monitor execution, one or more pages can be loaded. A set of components (resources) is loaded together with a page.
When you analyze individual monitor executions with the Waterfall chart, you can see detailed information about each resource loaded with the page during the monitor execution. The details include:

* Resource type, for example, script, image, font, data.
* Resource name.
* Resource load duration in ms.
* Resource initiator, for example, fetch, script, link. For details, see [Resource initiator](#resource-initiator).
* Render blocking status.
* Resource load start and end time.

The Waterfall chart can help you detect and isolate specific resources in specific executions that compromise overall performance. Also, it can help you analyze reasons behind the monitor's failures.

![Requests waterfall](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dva18020-dev-apps-dynatracelabs-com-ui-apps-dynatrace-synthetic-monitor-browser-synthetic-test-20b49e870a7513d7-execution-101467063807-1767976953634-waterfall-b66c336f493cc2af-ee600d99f4a5e478-tf-now-2h-3-1-2433-0f91ea90d9.png)

To analyze monitor executions via Waterfall chart

1. Select **Analyze executions** in the upper-right of the monitor details page.
2. Find the needed execution in the **Executions** table. Each row of the table is an execution record. You can use a filter  to narrow down the list of executions. You can filter by location or timeframe.

   If [automatic retry on error](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-configure-browser-monitors#outage-and-performance "Learn how to create and configure a browser monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.") is switched on, the monitor performs a second execution attempt in case the first attempt fails. In the **Executions** table, the second attempt is displayed by default, and a  icon appears in the execution recordâselect  to see the first attempt as well.
3. Select the execution.

   The **Pages** table with the execution details appears. In the **Steps** row, you can see all steps performed during the monitor execution. The timeframe when a step was performed is highlighted with a blue bar displayed in the row. Hover over the bar for the step details, such as the step duration, step type, and the UI element the step is performed to. You can filter  a specific step. In this case, only the bar associated with the filtered step remains blue. All other bars turn gray.

   Under the **Steps** row, the pages loaded during the monitor execution are displayed.

   During the monitor execution, pages can be opened in separate browser windows or tabs. In this case, a record for each window appears in the table with the  icon next to the record. Select the icon to see the pages loaded in that window.

   Under the **Steps** and window (if applicable) row, each consecutive row of the table is a loaded page record. The timeframe when the page was loaded is highlighted with a blue bar displayed in the record.
4. For the needed page, select the page record in the table.

   The **Requests waterfall** card appears, displaying the Waterfall chart for the selected page. The chart displays all resources that were loaded with the page during the execution of:

   * The monitor step when the page was loaded.
   * All subsequent monitor steps when the browser monitor interacted with the page (for example, clicks, keystrokes).

   You can select a resource to see its performance details. The resources loaded with errors have a red mark displayed in the **Type** column.

   ![Request waterfall - resources with errors](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dva18020-dev-apps-dynatracelabs-com-ui-apps-dynatrace-synthetic-monitor-browser-synthetic-test-20b49e870a7513d7-execution-101467063807-1767976953634-waterfall-b66c336f493cc2af-ee600d99f4a5e478-tf-now-2h-3-2-2475-dd4136cf22.png)

#### Resource initiator

The resource initiator is a web platform feature that initiated the resource load. When you know what was the resource initiator, you can, for example, detect the XHR actionsâtheir initiators are usually `xmlhttprequest` and `fetch`.

The resource initiator doesn't represent a type of fetched content. For example, a `.css` file can be fetched with a `<link>` elementâin this case, `link` is specified as the resource initiator.

| Initiator | Request initiated by |
| --- | --- |
| `audio` | `<audio>` element's src attribute |
| `beacon` | `navigator.sendBeacon()` method |
| `body` | `<body>` element's background attribute |
| `css` | CSS `url()` function |
| `early-hint` | 103 Early Hint response |
| `embed` | `<embed>` element's src attribute |
| `fetch` | `fetch()` method |
| `frame` | Loading a `<frame>` element |
| `icon` | A favicon; non-standard and only reported by Safari |
| `iframe` | `<iframe>` element's src attribute |
| `image` | `<image>` element |
| `img` | `<img>` element's src or srcset attribute |
| `input` | `<input>` element of type image |
| `link` | `<link>` element |
| `navigation` | A navigation request |
| `object` | `<object>` element |
| `other` | `(no condition matches)` |
| `ping` | `<a>` element's ping |
| `script` | `<script>` element |
| `track` | `<track>` element's src |
| `video` | `<video>` element's poster or src |
| `xmlhttprequest` | XMLHttpRequest |

# Create a NAM monitor

# Create a NAM monitor

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* 1-min read
* Updated on Dec 05, 2025

With network availability monitors (NAM), you can check the availability of your hosts, devices, and services.

There are three types of NAM monitors: ICMP, TCP, and DNS. To learn more about them, see [NAM types](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/network-availability-monitors/network-availability-monitoring#NAM-types "ICMP, TCP, and DNS synthetic monitors").
You can create NAM monitors in [![Synthetic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-new-256-1ddb35ac79.png "Synthetic") Synthetic](#monitor-configuration) in latest Dynatrace or through [API](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/network-availability-monitors/create-a-nam-monitor#nam-api "Learn how to set up a NAM monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.").

## NAM setup

With NAM monitors, you can include more than one step.

* Each step can contain one or multiple requests.
* Like for HTTP and browser monitors, steps are executed sequentially.
* Unlike for HTTP and browser monitors, NAM monitors can contain multiple requests within a single step. All requests assigned to a particular step are executed in parallel. If one request fails, it doesn't affect the execution of other requests within that step.
* A step is skipped if nothing matches its definition in a monitor configuration. For example, when a tag is specified in the [target filters](#target-filter) list but nothing matches the tag.
* Concept of requests executed in parallel exists for NAM monitors only

For example, if you want to monitor a group of 4 hosts with an ICMP test, you want to apply the same conditions (such as frequency, location executing test, and number of packets) for each host from your group.

NAM offers you the possibility of addressing this in multiple ways:

* You can define 4 separate tests, one per host. The benefit of this approach is that Dynatrace triggers a separate problem for each host and you can assign separate notifications for each one. You can also adjust test parameters for each host separately.
* You can define a single test with 4 requests (within 1 step). The same ICMP checks are executed, but there will be differences in reporting and alerting. The number or percentage of hosts that are down is reported with the Requests Success rate metric. You can configure a customized threshold for failing the whole monitor. For example, if it's OK that 1 out of 4 hosts is down, because of rolling out an update, you can define it on the `>=75%` level. There's always a single problem generated for a monitor, yet still, it contains detailed info about hosts that don't respond. Another benefit of this approach is easier maintenance (adjusting single setting for all 4 hosts).

  Finally, filters offer defining tests against dynamically changing structure, for example if you want to define ICMP tests against a given host group, you don't need to adjust the NAM monitor test after the host group configuration change.

You need to define constraints for each monitor. Constraints are conditions that need to be met to consider the monitorâs execution successful. It is obligatory to define the **Success rate** constraint. See [step-level constraints](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/network-availability-monitors/create-a-nam-monitor#step-level-constraints "Learn how to set up a NAM monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.") to learn more.

## Create a NAM monitor

To create a NAM monitor in latest Dynatrace

1. Go to ![Synthetic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-new-256-1ddb35ac79.png "Synthetic") **Synthetic** and select **Create monitor**.
2. Follow the on-screen steps as outlined in the sections below.

### Select type

The **Create synthetic monitor** page shows the types of synthetic monitor you can create.

Select **Network monitor (NAM)** to get started.

### General

* Required **Name this monitor**âThe name of the monitor as it will be displayed in the web UI (up to 500 characters).
* Required **Select a protocol**âChoose the monitor type: `DNS`, `ICMP`, or `TCP`.
* Optional **Set a description**âDescribe your monitor.
* Optional **Add tags to this monitor**âTo manually create a new tag, select **Add tag**, type the key, optionally provide a value, and select **Add**.

After you specify the general settings, select **Continue**.

### Requests

The **Requests** section has two editing modes. You can switch back and forth between these modes.

* default **Visual**âto view and configure NAM requests through web UI settings.
* **Script**âto view and edit request settings as JSON. The script you provide also serves as payload for API requests.

Settings per request (you can add multiple requests) are:

* Required **Request name**âThe name of the request.
* Required **List of targets** or **Filter expression**

  + You can provide targets for requests as an explicit list, or filter monitored hosts using a filter expression.

    - If you want to provide targets as IP or domain names, use **List of targets** to specify a comma-separated list of targets. Use this to monitor single or multiple hosts, devices, or services.
    - If you want to select some of the monitored hosts or custom devices, use **Filter expression** to specify a filter expression. This allows you to monitor a group of hosts or custom devices that meet the filter criteria. To learn more about available filters, see [target filter](#target-filter).

    You can combine both the **List of targets** and the **Filter expression** in a single monitor step. When used together, the monitor step will include the combined set of targets from both fields.
* Required **Execution attributes**âExecution attributes are essentially key/value pairs that are associated with your request. Define **Request timeout**, **Number of packets**, **Data length**, **Time to live**, **Timeout to reply**, you can also turn on or turn off **Do not fragment data**. Execution attributes are available for ICMP only.
* Required **Constraints**âConstraints are conditions that need to be met to consider monitorâs execution successful. You need to define **Constraint type**, **Operator** and **value**.

If you want to create another request, select **Add next request** and specify the above for the next request.

Use **Duplicate** ![Duplicate](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-app-tile-duplicate-f0d63fb901.svg "Duplicate") to duplicate a request and then edit it from that point instead of starting from scratch each time you add a request.

After you specify all requests, select **Continue**.

### Frequency and locations

In the **Frequency and locations** section, specify the frequency and locations.

* Required **Select frequency**âYou can choose a frequency (every `1 min`, `2 min`, `5 min`, `10 min`, `15 min`, `30 min`, or `1 h`) or select `On demand only` for manual execution.
* Required **n selected locations**âSpecify one or more locations.

After you specify the frequency and locations, select **Continue**.

### Outage and Performance

In **Outage handling**, you can enable and configure the following settings related to problem and alert generation:

* Optional "Generate a problem and send an alert when the monitor is unavailable at all configured locations (global outage)."
* Optional "Generate a problem and send an alert when the monitor is unavailable only when at least two locations are assigned." Note that this option is only possible if you selected two or more locations.
* Optional "Generate a problem and send an alert on performance threshold violations."

After you specify the outage and performance settings, select **Continue**.

### Summary

In the **Summary** section, verify your settings.

After you review the summary, select **Save** to create your monitor or **Back** to go back and adjust your monitor settings.

## Target filter

Target filter gives an option to filter **hosts monitored by Dynatrace** or **custom devices having IP addresses**. With this filter, you can select those two types of targets based on:

* type (`type`)
* tags (`tag`)
* host ID (`hostId`) (deprecated, works for hosts only, use entity ID instead)
* entity ID (`entityId`)
* host groups (`hostGroup`)
* management zones (`managementZone`)
* IP mask (`ipMask`)
* IP range (`ipRange`)
* process group instance (`processGroupInstance`)
* network interfaces of particular custom device (`interfacesOf`)
* extension name (`extensionName`)

IP range and IP mask are filters for hosts or devices known for the Dynatrace server, not an option to scan the network.

### Syntax

* Logical operators: `AND` and `OR` (case insensitive)
* Parentheses
* Expression operators: `==` and `!=`
* Tag names and values
* Negation ("not"): `!=`.
* Wildcard: `*` (selects all hosts monitored by Dynatrace)

### Examples

* `tag == tagname or hostGroup == group1`
* `(tag == tagname1:tagvalue1 or tag == tagname1:tagvalue2) and (hostGroup == group1 or managementZone == zone1)`
* `tag != tagname1 and tag != tagname2:tagvalue`
* `tag == tagname:tagvalue and (managementZone == zone1 or managementZone == zone2)`
* `tag == "[tagwithbrackets and spaces]":"value, with, commas, and, spaces"`
* `ipMask == 127.0.0.1/24`
* `hostId == HOST-000123`
* `type == CUSTOM_DEVICE and ipMask == 172.17.0.2/24`
* `entityId == HOST-045BFCDA3F507D30 or entityId == CUSTOM_DEVICE-13081D4B74B3E2C8`
* `type == HOST and processGroupInstance == PROCESS_GROUP_INSTANCE-07611353BB98908C`
* `type == CUSTOM_DEVICE and interfacesOf == CUSTOM_DEVICE-E1A88946BF04D5E7`
* `type == CUSTOM_DEVICE and extensionName == "Docker devices"`

## Performance thresholds

The performance threshold metric is compared to metric calculated for each request within monitor/step. For example, if TCP port check monitor, tests on the same host port `80` and `443` separately, Dynatrace compares threshold TCP connection establishment time twice, once for port `80` and once for port `443`.

There are three performance metrics for three types of NAM monitors:

* RTT for ICMP
* TCP connection establishment time for TCP
* DNS resolution time for DNS

Violating defined performance triggers a Problem (Slowdown).

Similarly to availability problems:

* Problems are opened per monitor
* Contains information about all requests responsible for problem

You can configure the way Dynatrace aggregates results for each packet for ICMP requests with single execution. Dynatrace supports AVG, MAX and MIN with `AVG` as the default method.

### Define thresholds

You can define performance thresholds when configuring the request for your synthetic monitor. The defined performance threshold is the same for all requests within a single step. In cases, where there's a need to build a multi-step NAM monitor, it's possible to define various thresholds for each step.

To define thresholds

1. Follow the steps described in [Create a NAM monitor](#monitor-configuration) section.
2. In the **Requests** step, scroll down the page and see **Performance thresholds alerting** section.
3. Select **Generate a problem and send an alert on performance threshold violations.** check box.
4. Turn on **Advanced performance thresholds settings** toggle.

   In this section you can set the **Number of request executions in analyzed sliding window** and the **Number of violating request executions in analyzed sliding window**. For de-alerting samples we require `n` most recent non-violating request executions.

### Violation reporting

Red color annotation over performance charts indicates the period of time during which the performance threshold is raised. Additionally, a threshold is drawn on the performance chart, and you can examine which requests are above the threshold.

You may narrow down the time range only to that for which the problem was active using zoom functionality.

# Create and configure an HTTP monitor

# Create and configure an HTTP monitor

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* 10-min read
* Updated on Nov 06, 2025

You can create synthetic HTTP monitors to check the availability of your resourcesâwebsites or API endpoints. HTTP monitors can be run from our [global public](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/public-synthetic-locations "Learn about all currently available public Synthetic Monitoring locations.") or [private](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring.") Synthetic locations.

## Create a new HTTP monitor

Go to ![Synthetic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-new-256-1ddb35ac79.png "Synthetic") **Synthetic** >  **Monitor** > **HTTP**.

### General

1. **Name this monitor**âenter a name (up to 500 characters) for the synthetic monitor. This name should generally describe all the requests in this HTTP monitor.
2. Select **Add tag** to manually apply tags to the monitor. After the monitor has been created, you can manage tags from the [HTTP monitor details page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/synthetic-details-for-http-monitors#properties-tags "Learn about the Synthetic details page for HTTP monitors.").
3. Select **Assign frontends** to assign a monitor to a frontend application. You can assign the monitor to multiple applications, and an application can have several assigned monitors. It allows you to track application availability and performance. Detected problems are then automatically associated with your application. If the monitor is unavailable, the associated application is also considered to be unavailable.

   Note that you cannot block Synthetic Monitoring traffic for RUM applications by [excluding bots, spiders, or the IP addresses of Synthetic locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/exclude-browsers-robots-and-spiders-from-monitoring "Disable Real User Monitoring for certain IP addresses, browsers, bots, and spiders.").

### Requests

You can configure one or more requests in **Visual** or **Script** mode. In **Visual** mode the settings are shown in couple of groups:

* Basic configuration (request name and URL)
* Security (authentication and client certificateâfor both of them an existing credential saved in the credential vault can be selected or users can create a new one)

  + In **Security** section, turn on the **Set authentication/authorization** toggle to select the **Basic**, **NTLM** or **Kerberos** security method. For more details, see [synthetic authentication](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/synthetic-authentication#basic-ntlm "Learn how to configure authentication methods for monitoring web applications and API endpoints in Synthetic Monitoring.").
* SSL certificate (accept any SSL certificate and generate a problem if SSL certificate expires within the next `n` days)
* Execution attributes (HTTP method, user agent, additional HTTP headers and advanced attributes: follow redirects, ignore sensitive information, pre-/-post-execution script)
* Advanced attributes

  + **Ignore sensitive information** checkboxâexpand the **Advanced attributes** section and select this option to hide potentially sensitive information (contained in, say, the request headers, request body, sometimes URL).

    You need to do this for each request you wish to limit the display of. Request and response bodies, values of request and response headers, and peer certificate details are then replaced by placeholder text.

  Users with access to any credentials contained in the monitor may disable it.
* Constraints (response status code, response body pattern, response body regex)
* Performance thresholds alerting (threshold for this request)
* Basic configuration (request name)

  + **Name**âobligatory field which stands for a monitor step
* Target selection (URL)

  + **HTTP request URL**

    - To enhance synthetic monitor security, Dynatrace blocks monitors from sending requests to a local host (for example, `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`).
    - You can add a credential ID from the [vault](/docs/manage/credential-vault "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.") to the request URL. Use the format `{<credential ID>|token}`, `{<credential ID>|username}`, or `{<credential ID>|password}`, for example `https://example.com/api/random/{CREDENTIALS_VAULT-0000000000000000|token}` as appropriate for the type of credential you're inserting. You can only copy and paste credentials to which you have access.

      Who can edit a monitor that has associated credentials?

      * If a monitor is associated with a public credential, anyone on your team can switch on/off, delete, or edit the monitor.

      * If an HTTP monitor is associated with restricted credential (owner only or shared with a few users), any user can make changes to certain fields, even if they don't have access to the credential used. You can edit monitor name, locations, validation, thresholds, and, of course, change a certificate or a UID/password pair. You can edit and change the credentials in a URL, header value, or request body. You can create a credential within monitor settings in edit mode. You'll need to change all credentials in the monitor to ones that you have access to. Note that replacing another user's credential with one you have access to is irreversible.

        Controls that you cannot edit such as the request URL, HTTP method, pre-execution script, post-execution script, HTTP headers, request body, the follow redirects option, and adding/deleting HTTP requests are grayed out or display an error message when you attempt to save changes, whether in script or UI mode.

      * You can make active/inactive or delete a synthetic monitor that's secured by another user's owner-only credentials.

        Read more about credential permissions in [Credential vault for synthetic monitors](/docs/manage/credential-vault "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.").
* Security (authentication and client certificateâfor both of them an existing credential saved in the credential vault can be selected or users can create a new one)

  + Turn on the **Set authentication/authorization** toggle to select the **Basic**, **NTLM** or **Kerberos** security method. For more details, see [synthetic authentication](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/synthetic-authentication#basic-ntlm "Learn how to configure authentication methods for monitoring web applications and API endpoints in Synthetic Monitoring.").

    Provide a username/password pair to automate the login process for password-protected sites via **Basic**, **NTLM**, or **Kerberos** authentication. Dynatrace automatically generates the required `Authorization` header with the information you've provided. (Read more about [Supported authentication methods in Synthetic Monitoring](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/synthetic-authentication "Learn how to configure authentication methods for monitoring web applications and API endpoints in Synthetic Monitoring.").)

    Dynatrace stores and manages all Synthetic Monitoring credentials in a credential vault. Credentials are access controlled and can be designated as owner only or public.

    You can choose an existing credential (**Select credentials**). You can only see the credentials that you have access to in this list, that is, public credentials or owner-only credentials created by you.

    You can create **New credential** by entering a **Username** and **Password**. Provide a **Credential name** and **Save to vault**.

    The `<domain>\<username>` format is not supported for the username in HTTP monitors; simply provide the `<username>`.

    The credentials you create this way are automatically set to owner-only permissions and can only be used by you. Note that you can create credentials this way in a new or existing HTTP monitor even if you don't have permissions to access credential management in the [credential vault](/docs/manage/credential-vault "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.").
  + Turn on the **Add client certificate** toggle to switch on client-side certificate authentication. To learn more, see [Supported authentication methods in Synthetic Monitoring](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/synthetic-authentication "Learn how to configure authentication methods for monitoring web applications and API endpoints in Synthetic Monitoring.").

    Dynatrace stores and manages all Synthetic Monitoring credentials in a credential vault. Credentials are access controlled and can be designated as owner only or public.

    You can choose an existing credential (**Select credentials**). You can only see the credentials that you have access to in this list, that is, public credentials or owner-only credentials created by you.

    You can create a new credential:

    1. Select **+ New credential**.
    2. Upload a **Certificate file** (in PFX, P12, or PEM format).
    3. Enter a **Password**.
    4. Provide a **Credential name**.
    5. Select **Save to vault**.

    The credentials you create this way are automatically set to owner-only permissions and can only be used by you. Note that you can create credentials this way in a new or existing HTTP monitor even if you don't have permissions to access credential management in the [credential vault](/docs/manage/credential-vault "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.").

    To assure full mutual authentication, switch off **Accept any SSL certificate** when using certificate authentication.
* SSL certificate (accept any SSL certificate and generate a problem if SSL certificate expires within the next `n` days)

  + **Accept any SSL certificate**âby default, HTTP monitors fail when SSL certificates are invalid. Check the box to make the monitor accept any SSL certificates regardless of whether they're valid.

    Reasons for SSL certificate invalidity

    Depending on your settings, your HTTP monitor can fail or succeed when an SSL certificate is invalid for any of the following reasons:

    - Certificate is self signed
    - Certificate has expired
    - Certificate is inactive
    - Certificate lifetime is greater than 398 days
    - Missing hostname
    - Invalid/incomplete certificate chain
    - Untrusted certificate authority
    - Insecure signature algorithm

  + **Generate a problem if the SSL certificate expires within the next n days**âturn on this option to generate an **SSL certificate expiration problem** when an SSL certificate is missing, expired, or will expire within the specified number of days (must be 100 or less). Note that, this problem is generated without failing the monitor or affecting monitor availability.

    SSL certificate expiration problems have the custom severity level and display the number of days remaining until certificate expiry. This value is updated with each execution of the affected monitor.

    The following examples show how to apply the **SSL certificate expiration date verification** and **Accept any SSL certificate** settings.

    - If you want to configure a monitor that accepts a self-signed certificate while triggering an alert for certificate expiry, you would:

      * Turn on **Accept any SSL certificate**.
      * Turn on **SSL certificate expiration date verification** and set a threshold for problem generation.
    - If you choose not to accept any SSL certificate, and the SSL certificate has expired, the HTTP monitor will fail and trigger an outage problem with an `SSL certificate expired` message in problem details and in the **Events** and **Failed requests** cards in [HTTP monitor details](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/synthetic-details-for-http-monitors "Learn about the Synthetic details page for HTTP monitors.").
    - If you turn on both these options, and the SSL certificate has expired, the HTTP monitor will trigger an SSL certificate expiration problem. The **Events** card will display a custom alert for SSL certificate expiration.
    - If you turn on both these options and specify a threshold of `n` days for SSL certificate expiry, and the SSL certificate expires within `n` days, the HTTP monitor will trigger an SSL certificate expiration problem. The **Events** card will display a custom alert for SSL certificate expiration.

      HTTP monitor validation

      The following types of rules are evaluated for HTTP monitor validation in the `validation.rules` section in [script mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/script-mode-for-http-monitor-configuration-classic "Create or edit your HTTP monitors in JSON format.").

      * Response status code validation
      * Text validation, where the first 50 KB of the response body is checked for a string of text or a regular expression
      * SSL certificate expiry validation (ActiveGate version 1.235+)

      In a monitor containing multiple validations, all rules are evaluated. However, a single execution status is returned based on priority: HTTP status code validation is the most important, followed by text and regular expression validation, and finally by SSL certificate expiry validation.
* Execution attributes (HTTP method, user agent, additional HTTP headers and advanced attributes: follow redirects, ignore sensitive information, pre-/-post-execution script)

  + **HTTP request method**

    For each request you create or edit, start with the **HTTP method**, because the available request settings depend on this selection. Supported HTTP methods are:

    - GET
    - POST
    - PUT
    - DELETE
    - HEAD
    - PATCH
    - OPTIONS
  + Optional [**User agent**ï»¿](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent)

    The default user agent is in the format `DynatraceSynthetic/{version}`, where `{version}` is the current version of the Synthetic engine executing the monitor. Even if you define a custom user agent, Dynatrace automatically appends `DynatraceSynthetic/{version}` to the user agent to make sure that synthetic monitoring traffic can be identified. **Do not** use `DynatraceSynthetic/` in your custom user agent; this is reserved for Dynatrace use.

  + **Set additional HTTP headers**

    The monitor is created with a bare minimum set of headers required by the protocol. Choose this option to create custom/additional headers:

    1. Select **+ HTTP header**.
    2. Enter **Header name** and **Header value**.
    3. Add another header by clicking **+ HTTP header** as needed.

    Use HTTP headers to implement bearer or token authenticationâread more in [Supported authentication methods in Synthetic Monitoring](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/synthetic-authentication#bearer-token "Learn how to configure authentication methods for monitoring web applications and API endpoints in Synthetic Monitoring.").

    You can add token credentials to the header value. Use the format `{<credential ID>|token}`, `{<credential ID>|username}`, or `{<credential ID>|password}`, for example `{CREDENTIALS_VAULT-0000000000000000|token}` as appropriate for the type of credential you're inserting. You can only copy and paste credentials to which you have access.

    Default HTTP headers

    These are the default headers Dynatrace creates per request.

    Name

    Value

    `Accept`

    `*/*`

    `Connection`

    `close`

    `Host`

    `<hostname>`

    `User-Agent`

    `DynatraceSynthetic/{version}`[1](#fn-1-1-def)

    1

    `{version}` is the current version of the Synthetic engine executing the monitor. Even if you [define a custom user agent](#basic-settings), Dynatrace always automatically adds `DynatraceSynthetic/{version}` to the user agent to make sure that synthetic monitoring traffic can be identified.

    Dynatrace also creates the `x-Dynatrace-Tenant`, and `x-Dynatrace-Test` headers for internal administrative purposes.
  + **Set request body**

    You can send a payload with your **POST**, **PUT**, **DELETE**, and **PATCH** requests. You can add token credentials to the request body. Use the format `{<credential ID>|token}`, `{<credential ID>|username}`, or `{<credential ID>|password}`, for example `{CREDENTIALS_VAULT-0000000000000000|token}` as appropriate for the type of credential you're inserting. You can only use credentials to which you have access, that is, public credentials or owner-only credentials created by you. If this field contains an [owner-only token](/docs/manage/credential-vault#owner-shared-public "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault."), it cannot be edited by other users.
* Advanced attributes

  + **Follow redirects**âby default, an HTTP monitor follows up to 10 redirects from an original request until it reaches the final destination. Turn this option off to monitor only the first response of the redirect chain, for example, to check redirect response status codes.
  + **Set pre-execution script**â[pre- and post-execution scripts](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/pre-and-post-scripting-for-http-monitors-classic "Learn how to apply pre and post scripts to your requests") allows you to add custom logic between HTTP monitor requests to do things like parsing the response, modifying the request URL, or skipping requests under certain conditions.

    If you choose this, an edit box is displayed for you to enter a script that is executed just before the request is triggered. Pre-execution scripts are based on custom JavaScript code and can be used to build your HTTP request or to add logic that you cannot or do not want to implement in the UI.

    For more information and a method reference, see [Pre- and post-execution scripts for HTTP monitors](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/pre-and-post-scripting-for-http-monitors-classic#methods "Learn how to apply pre and post scripts to your requests"). Note that some methods are only available for use in [pre-execution scripts](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/pre-and-post-scripting-for-http-monitors-classic#pre-execution "Learn how to apply pre and post scripts to your requests") or [post-execution scripts](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/pre-and-post-scripting-for-http-monitors-classic#post-execution "Learn how to apply pre and post scripts to your requests").
  + **Set post-execution script**âif you choose this, an edit box is displayed for you to enter a script that is executed after the request is completed. Post-execution scripts are based on custom JavaScript code and can be used process responses to the request.

    The [`api.fail()` method](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/pre-and-post-scripting-for-http-monitors-classic#end "Learn how to apply pre and post scripts to your requests") can be used to define a custom **Failure message** that appears in the Events card on the [HTTP monitor details page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/synthetic-details-for-http-monitors "Learn about the Synthetic details page for HTTP monitors.").

    For more information and a method reference, see [Pre- and post-execution scripts for HTTP monitors](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/pre-and-post-scripting-for-http-monitors-classic "Learn how to apply pre and post scripts to your requests"). Note that some methods are only available for use in [pre-execution scripts](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/pre-and-post-scripting-for-http-monitors-classic#pre-execution "Learn how to apply pre and post scripts to your requests") or [post-execution scripts](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/pre-and-post-scripting-for-http-monitors-classic#post-execution "Learn how to apply pre and post scripts to your requests").
  + **Ignore sensitive information**âselect this option to hide potentially sensitive information (contained in, say, the request headers, request body, sometimes URL).
* Constraints (response status code, response body pattern, response body regex)

  Response validation allows you to pass/fail your monitor based on expected content in the first 50 KB of the response body.

  + **Pass if** or **Fail if** determines the basic test.
  + **Text contains** specifies the text to look for in the response. This string is case sensitive. If your string contains non-ASCII characters, escape them in [script mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/script-mode-for-http-monitor-configuration-classic "Create or edit your HTTP monitors in JSON format.").
  + **Interpret content match as regular expression** treats the specified text as a [regular expression](/docs/manage/tags-and-metadata/reference/regular-expressions-in-dynatrace "Learn how to use regular expressions in the context of Dynatrace.").

  You can add two or more constraints of the same type, for example, if your case requires finding two or more patterns within the response body.

  You can set up multiple such text-validation rules in [script mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/script-mode-for-http-monitor-configuration-classic "Create or edit your HTTP monitors in JSON format.").

  HTTP monitor validation

  The following types of rules are evaluated for HTTP monitor validation in the `validation.rules` section in [script mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/script-mode-for-http-monitor-configuration-classic "Create or edit your HTTP monitors in JSON format.").

  + Response status code validation
  + Text validation, where the first 50 KB of the response body is checked for a string of text or a regular expression
  + SSL certificate expiry validation (ActiveGate version 1.235+)

  In a monitor containing multiple validations, all rules are evaluated. However, a single execution status is returned based on priority: HTTP status code validation is the most important, followed by text and regular expression validation, and finally by SSL certificate expiry validation.
* Performance thresholds alerting (threshold for this request)

  You can use the **Generate a problem and send an alert on performance threshold violations** toggle to set up the timeout threshold for this particular request of the HTTP monitor. The problems triggering and alerting in case of violating performance threshold must be additionlly set when configuring [Outage and performance](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-and-configure-an-http-monitor#outage-and-performance "Learn how to set up and edit an HTTP monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.").

In **Visual** mode, you can also:

* Select  icon and drag it up or down to change the order of requests.
* Select  icon and delete the request.
* Select  icon and duplicate the request.

### Frequency and locations

Two factors make up your monitoring scheduleâhow frequently your browser monitor runs and the number of locations it's executed from.

Dynatrace offers a global network of [public Synthetic Monitoring locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/public-synthetic-locations "Learn about all currently available public Synthetic Monitoring locations.") out-of-the-box. You can also [create private Synthetic locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring.") within your own network infrastructure. Both public and private locations appear on this settings page.

The frequency and number of locations determine the number of monitor executions per hour. For example, running a monitor from 3 locations every 15 minutes results in 12 executions per hour (4 times per hour from each of the 3 locations). Monitor executions are evenly spaced within the selected interval. That is, for a monitor running from 3 locations every 15 minutes, executions are triggered at 5-minute intervals.

You can choose a frequency of every **5**, **10**, **15**, or **30** minutes; or **1**, **2**, or **4** hours. You can also set up your monitor to be executed [**On demand only**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/on-demand-executions "Execute synthetic monitors on demand from public or private locations"). You can select multiple global locations from where your browser monitor is to be executed.

Note that all public Synthetic locations are set to Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC. If your monitor script requires the local time or time zone, you can use the [`api.getContext()` method](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/browser-clickpath-events#retrieve-data "Learn about the event types created when recording a browser clickpath.") and the system clock to implement conditional logic.

### Outage and performance

You can set global and local **Outage handling** and **Performance thresholds** for the sum of all requests.

* **Generate a problem and send an alert when this monitor is unavailable at all configured locations (global outage).**

  This setting is enabled by default for newly created monitors. It alerts you of global availability outages, that is, when all locations experience a failure simultaneously.

  By default, a global outage problem is generated when all locations fail one time. However, you can specify the number of consecutive failures (from 1 to 5) for a global outage problem, that is, how many times all locations need to fail consecutively in order to generate a global outage problem.
* **Generate a problem and send an alert when this monitor is unavailable for one or more consecutive runs at any location. Local outage problem generation is available only when at least two locations are assigned.**

  This allows you to raise a problem when there are consecutive failures at one or more locations. At the environment level, you can choose the number of failures. At the monitor level, you can also determine the number of monitor locations that need to fail in order to generate a local outage problem.

For **Performance thresholds**, you can turn on:

* **Generate a problem and send an alert on performance threshold violations.**

  This setting provides an option to set the **Threshold for the sum of all requests (in seconds)**. If the threshold exceeds the time you provided, you'll be notified.

### Summary

See the summary of all the steps and the estimated monthly number of requests.

See [HTTP monitors reporting results](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/synthetic-details-for-http-monitors "Learn about the Synthetic details page for HTTP monitors.") for monitoring analytics of each monitor.

# Create and configure a browser monitor

# Create and configure a browser monitor

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Updated on Jan 30, 2026

You can create synthetic browser monitors to check the availability of your websites. Browser monitors can be run from our [global public](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/public-synthetic-locations "Learn about all currently available public Synthetic Monitoring locations.") or [private](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations "Learn how to manage private locations in the Synthetic app.") synthetic locations.

Go to ![Synthetic Classic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-512-83ec796e54.png "Synthetic Classic") **Synthetic** >  **New monitor** > **Browser**. The configuration settings are split into the following sections:

* [General](#general)
* [Steps](#steps)
* [Frequency and locations](#frequency-and-locations)
* [Outage and performance](#outage-and-performance)
* [Advanced setup](#advanced-setup)
* [Summary](#summary)

Go through all the sections one by one and make all needed configurations within each section.

## General

To start with, configure the general settings.

1. **Name this monitor**âenter a name (up to 500 characters) for the synthetic monitor. This name should generally describe all the requests in this browser monitor.

2. Select **Add tag** to manually apply tags to the monitor.
3. Select **Assign frontends** to assign a monitor to a frontend application. You can assign the monitor to multiple frontend applications, and a frontend application can have several assigned monitors. It allows you to track the frontend application availability and performance. Detected problems are then automatically associated with your frontend application. If the monitor's executions fail due to problems with the frontend application, the reported availability rate of the frontend application is decreased within a specific timeframe.

   A browser monitor can be assigned to a fronted application automatically if a URL checked by the monitor matches a pattern defined in [![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/experience-vitals "The Experience Vitals app provides an entry point for monitoring web and mobile frontends.").

Advanced settings

4. Optional Specify **Device profile**. You can choose from:

   * **Existing devices** with preset characteristics. You can modify only the orientationâmake it either landscape or portrait.
   * **Custom device**âadd a new device with custom characteristics like orientation (landscape or portrait), screen height, and screen width, and provide the new device's **Custom name**.
5. Optional Specify **Bandwidth profile**. You can choose from:

   * **Existing profile** with ready-to-use presets.
   * **Custom profile**âadd a new bandwidth profile with custom characteristics like download speed, upload speed, and latency, and provide the new profile's **Custom name**.
6. Optional Specify **User agent** to adjust a user agent HTTP header that is sent from the browser during the monitor's executions. When you choose **Device profile** from **Existing devices**, Dynatrace pre-populates **User agent**.

   The default Dynatrace user agent during recording and local playback is in the format `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/{version} Safari/537.36 RuxitSynthetic/1.0 v0 t0 cfeatureHash=7efgijmoqtvx caes=1 ccux=1 sia=1 smf=1`, where:

   * `{version}` is the current Chrome version used for recording.
   * `v0` and `t0` identify Synthetic Monitoring traffic.
   * `sia=1` indicates faster RUM JavaScript injection (value can be `1` or `0`).
   * `smf=1` indicates monitoring of pages in frames (if **Capture performance metrics for pages loaded in frames** is switched on in [**Advanced setup**](#other); value is `0` if not switched on).
   * `cfeatureHash=<value>` appears when custom RUM JavaScript settings are switched on in [**Advanced setup**](#custom-rum-js-settings).
   * The default user agent string for browser monitor execution from public or private Synthetic locations is `Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/{version} Safari/537.36 RuxitSynthetic/1.0 v{id} t{id} ath{id} alt{id} cfeatureHash=7efgijmoqtvx caes=1 ccux=1 sia=1 smf=1`, where:

     + `{id}` represents long IDs used by Dynatrace to identify a monitor execution.
     + Other parameters are as described above.

     Note that even if a custom user agent is defined, Dynatrace always automatically adds `RuxitSynthetic/1.0 v{id} t{id} ath{id} alt{id}`, `sia`, `smf`, and, if applicable, `cfeaturehash` and any key-value pairs beginning with `c` to the user agent to make sure that Synthetic Monitoring traffic can be identified.

## Steps

Define the steps. You have two options when you create a browser monitor:

* Set up a monitor to test a single web page against availability and performance. To do so, perform steps 1â7 and step 9 in the guide below (skip step 8).
* Set up a monitor to perform a test scenario that includes a user journeyâfor example, when they open the home page in a browser, apply search criteria, perform search, and select an option from the search results. To do so, complete all the steps listed below (1â9).

1. **Name**âprovide a step name.
2. **URL**âprovide a URL of a web page you want to test against availability and performance.
3. Optional Provide **Context setup**. You can specify:

   * Cookies that will be sent with requests performed by the monitor.
   * Request headers that will be set for all requests performed by the monitor.
   * Requests with specific patterns that will be blocked during the monitor executions.

   Although you can specify cookies, headers, and requests with specific patterns later in [Advanced setup](#advanced-setup), in some cases it may be reasonable to do it here to ensure smooth [recording of a clickpath](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-configure-browser-monitors/clickpath-synthetic-app-browser-monitor "Learn how to record a browser clickpath for a browser monitor").
4. Optional Turn on **Use HTTP authentication** if the website you want to test is protected by HTTP authentication (not handled by web form authentication).

   We support a basic **HTTP authentication** and **Kerberos** authentication. If you choose **Kerberos** as an authentication, also provide a realm name and authentication server allow list.

   You can choose how you want to store credentials.

   * **Credential Vault**âa recommended option since it provides more security. Select previously existing credentials or add new ones.

     You can add new credentials in both ![Synthetic Classic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-512-83ec796e54.png "Synthetic Classic") **Synthetic** ( **Add credential**) and previous Dynatrace (**Credential vault (classic)**).
   * **Monitor script**âprovide a username and password.
5. Optional Choose the **Condition to consider this step as done** to [define a waiting time between steps](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-configure-browser-monitors/steps-waiting-time-validation-thresholds#steps-waiting-time "Learn how to customize a waiting time between steps, validate content, and set up performance thresholds.").
6. Optional In the **Validate content** section, set up [content validation rules](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-configure-browser-monitors/steps-waiting-time-validation-thresholds#validate-content "Learn how to customize a waiting time between steps, validate content, and set up performance thresholds.").
7. Optional Set up a [performance threshold](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-configure-browser-monitors/steps-waiting-time-validation-thresholds#performance-thresholds "Learn how to customize a waiting time between steps, validate content, and set up performance thresholds.") for loading of the page specified in the **URL**.
8. Record a clickpath or add steps manually. Use this functionality if you want the monitor to perform a test scenario that includes a user journeyâfor example, when they open the home page in browser, apply search criteria, perform search, and select an option from the search results. For details, see [Record a browser clickpath](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-configure-browser-monitors/clickpath-synthetic-app-browser-monitor "Learn how to record a browser clickpath for a browser monitor").

   ![Browser monitor steps](https://dt-cdn.net/images/screenshot-2025-08-29-151144-1417-d6dc411680.png)
9. Select **Continue** to proceed with the monitor configuration.

## Frequency and locations

Two factors make up your monitoring scheduleâhow frequently your browser monitor runs and the number of locations it's executed from.

Dynatrace offers a global network of [public Synthetic Monitoring locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/public-synthetic-locations "Learn about all currently available public Synthetic Monitoring locations.") out of the box. You can also [create private Synthetic locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations "Learn how to manage private locations in the Synthetic app.") within your own network infrastructure. Both public and private locations appear on this settings page.

The frequency and number of locations determine the number of monitor executions per hour. For example, running a monitor from 3 locations every 15 minutes results in 12 executions per hour (4 times per hour from each of the 3 locations). Monitor executions are evenly spaced within the selected interval. That is, for a monitor running from 3 locations every 15 minutes, executions are triggered at 5-minute intervals.

You can choose a frequency of every **5**, **10**, **15**, or **30** minutes; or **1**, **2**, or **4** hours. You can also set up your monitor to be executed [**On demand only**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/on-demand-executions "Learn about how to perform on-demand executions."). You can select multiple global locations from where your browser monitor is to be executed.

Note that all public Synthetic locations are set to Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC. If your monitor script requires the local time or time zone, you can use the [`api.getContext()` method](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-configure-browser-monitors/browser-clickpath-steps#retrieve-data "Learn about the step types created when recording a browser clickpath") and the system clock to implement conditional logic.

## Outage and performance

You can set global and local **Outage handling** and **Performance thresholds** for the sum of all requests.

* **Generate a problem and send an alert when this monitor is unavailable at all configured locations (global outage).**

  This setting is turned on by default for newly created monitors. It alerts you of global availability outages, that is, when all locations experience a failure simultaneously.

  By default, a global outage problem is generated when all locations fail one time. However, you can specify the number of consecutive failures (from 1 to 5) for a global outage problem, that is, how many times all locations need to fail consecutively in order to generate a global outage problem.
* **Generate a problem and send an alert when this monitor is unavailable for one or more consecutive runs at any location. Local outage problem generation is available only when at least two locations are assigned.**

  This allows you to raise a problem when there are consecutive failures at one or more locations. At the environment level, you can choose the number of failures. At the monitor level, you can also determine the number of monitor locations that need to fail in order to generate a local outage problem.

**Automatic retry on error** is turned on by default (you can turn it off if needed), which means that failing monitor executions are retried immediately one time to avoid false positives, and only the second result is taken into account. When turned off, we proceed with the first result right away.

For **Performance thresholds**, you can turn on:

* **Generate a problem and send an alert on performance threshold violations.**

  This setting provides an option to set the **Threshold for the sum of all requests (in seconds)**. If the threshold exceeds the time you provided, you'll be notified.

  Also, you can set a performance threshold for [separate steps](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-configure-browser-monitors/steps-waiting-time-validation-thresholds#performance-thresholds "Learn how to customize a waiting time between steps, validate content, and set up performance thresholds.").

## Advanced setup

This tab contains controls for:

* [Client certificates](#certificate-authentication)
* [Cookies](#cookies)
* [HTTP headers](#http-headers)
* [Request blocking](#block-requests)
* [Ignoring status codes](#ignore-status-codes)
* [Custom RUM JavaScript settings](#custom-rum-js-settings)
* [Bypassing CSP rules](#other)
* [Capturing metrics for pages loaded in frames](#other)

### Use client certificates

Dynatrace version 1.272+

ActiveGate version 1.271+

You can set up certificate authentication for browser monitors running on any [public location](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/public-synthetic-locations "Learn about all currently available public Synthetic Monitoring locations.") and [private locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations "Learn how to manage private locations in the Synthetic app.") with Linux-based ActiveGates (containerized as well as non-containerized).

Before first recording a clickpath on a website that requires certificate authentication, ensure that you have installed the required certificate in Chrome. Then, when you navigate to the website in the recording window, the native browser dialog simply selects the correct certificate.

After you record the clickpath, you need to specify the certificate to use for browser monitor execution.

1. Select **Add certificate**.
2. Enter the **Domain** that the certificate is valid for.
3. Select a credential from the list of certificate credentials displayed. Alternatively, select **Create new credential** to upload and use a new client certificate. Any certificate credential you create is automatically designated as [owner only](/docs/manage/credential-vault#work-with-credentials "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.") and stored in the [credential vault](/docs/manage/credential-vault "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.").

You can specify and upload certificate files in PFX, P12, or PEM format.

### Set cookies

Cookies allow you to store browser state information on the client side so that each monitor execution is based on the same state and you can accurately monitor a performance baseline.

The cookies set in **Advanced setup** are valid for the entire monitor execution. If you want to set cookies only for a specific portion of your clickpath, use the [Cookie step](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-configure-browser-monitors/browser-clickpath-steps#cookie "Learn about the step types created when recording a browser clickpath").

Select **Add cookie**, provide a **Name** and cookie **Value**. Every cookie must be unique within the list.

The following symbols are not allowed in the cookie value: `;,\"`. Provide the **Domain** of the cookie, and optionally, the **Path** to the cookie.

### Add additional HTTP headers

The monitor is created with a bare minimum set of headers required by the protocol.

1. Select **Add header**.
2. Enter a **Header** name and **Value**.

You can specify multiple HTTP headers. They will be set for all requests the monitor makes.

If you want to set headers only for specific requests, select **Only apply headers to requests matching a pattern** and then define a **Pattern**. After that, the header is only set for requests that match the pattern youâve defined.

### Block specific requests

You can block one or more requests by specifying complete URLs or match patterns. The URL or regex string cannot exceed 90 characters and is case insensitive.

Blocking requests allows you to analyze how these requests affect your application's performance and optimize it accordingly.

Select **Add pattern**, and then provide a complete URL.

You can also define patterns, for example, `http:*://*/*.png` or `https*://*/*.png` to block all requests to PNG images.

Matching requests are blocked throughout monitor execution and arenât dependent on events.

If you're unable to block specific requests, refer to the Dynatrace Community article [Unable to block specific requests (owing to limitations on the length of regular expressions)ï»¿](https://dt-url.net/w0i2xhk).

### Ignore specific status codes

This allows you to exclude HTTP status codes 400â599 from causing availability outages/errors if encountered in the main document request. Typically, this is the base page in a load action. If this setting is turned on, and the base page of a load action encounters HTTP errors 400â599, an availability outage is not triggered.

You can specify an exact status code, range, or status class mask. Use commas to separate multiple values; use the minus sign (`-`) with no spaces for a range, for example, `404, 405-410, 5xx`. You can apply the rule only to document requests that match a specific regular expression (**Only apply to document request matching this regex**).

* This setting does not apply to XHR requests or document requests in iframes; browser monitors do not fail when an XHR request or a document request in an iframe fails.
* This setting applies to future executions, that is, executions that take place after the setting is turned on.

### Custom RUM JavaScript settings

**Capture XmlHttpRequest (XHR)** and **Capture fetch() requests** are turned on by default. You can turn them off.

### Other

**Bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) of monitored page**âif you have a Content Security Policy in place, it's likely to prevent the browser from sending monitoring data to the Dynatrace Cluster. As a first and preferred method to have Chrome bypass the CSP of any monitored pages in your single-URL browser monitor or browser clickpath, turn on this option. If you're unable to use this option for some reason, refer to the advanced solutions for bypassing CSP in the Dynatrace Community article [Browser monitors: Issues with Content Security Policyï»¿](https://dt-url.net/ycs2x56).

**Capture performance metrics for pages loaded in frames**âturn this on to begin capturing performance data for pages in iframes or framesets.

## Summary

See the summary of all the steps and the estimated monthly number of actions. If everything's OK, and no more adjustments are needed, **Save** the newly configured monitor.

On-demand monitor execution

[On-demand monitor execution](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/on-demand-executions "Learn about how to perform on-demand executions.") via web UI is available as part of DPS license only. The retention period for data from monitor execution is 35 days.  
For Non-DPS license users, monitor execution is possible via [API](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/synthetic-v2/synthetic-monitor-execution "View the results of Synthetic monitor executions via the Synthetic v2 API."). You can access the results for the last 6 hours.

To display a reporting page for your monitor, select **View details** in upper-right corner of the preview panel.

The default reporting pages consists of:

* Tiles displaying information at a glance about global outages, active issues, number of affected locations, availability, total downtime, and duration.
* **Availability**âa chart of availability over time. Availability for NAM monitors is calculated by comparing the request success rate to defined [constraints](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/network-availability-monitors/create-a-nam-monitor#script-configuration-constraints "Learn how to set up a NAM monitor to check the performance and availability of your site."). A period when availability is 0% is called an outage.

  You can narrow the chart's time range to cover just the outage period. This allows you to identify, for example, requests that negatively impact availability. By default, the availability chart is collapsed when showing 0% or 100% for the whole time range. To open it, simply select **Availability**.
* **Success rate**âa chart of the success rate over time, where the success rate is the percentage of all executed requests that were sucessful.

  + See the [conditions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/network-availability-monitors/create-a-nam-monitor#script-configuration-constraints "Learn how to set up a NAM monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.") a request needs to meet to be considered successful.
  + Select the **Show requests** button under the chart to see availability changes such as the average performance, average availability, and packet success rate (this column is only available for ICMP).
* **Performance**âa chart of performance over time, where performance is calculated as an average for all successful requests. Note that performance metrics are not reported for failed requests.
* **Changes**âa history log that displays:

  + When the monitor was created and who created it.
  + Who changed the monitor properties, when the change was made, and which properties were changed in the selected timeframe.

# On-demand monitor executions

# On-demand monitor executions

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* 15-min read
* Updated on Jun 23, 2025

To trigger an execution via the web UI

1. In the upper-right corner of the monitor's details page, select **On-demand execution**.
2. From the **Locations** list, select the locations for which you want to trigger on-demand execution.

   Note that you can select a combination of **Assigned locations** and **Unassigned public locations** for this execution.
3. Select a **Processing mode**âthis applies to all selected locations for this execution.

   * **Standard** (default)âthe executions contribute to problem detection and availability and performance statistics. You can access execution results when you [**Analyze executions**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/browser-monitors-results-reporting#analyze-executions "Learn about the Browser details page for Browser monitors.").
   * **Disable problem detection**âthe executions contribute to availability and performance statistics but not to problem detection. You can view execution results when you [**Analyze executions**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/browser-monitors-results-reporting#analyze-executions "Learn about the Browser details page for Browser monitors.").
   * **Execution details only**âthe executions do not contribute to availability and performance statistics or to problem detection. You can still access results when you [**Analyze executions**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/browser-monitors-results-reporting#analyze-executions "Learn about the Browser details page for Browser monitors.").

   Note that for all processing modes, executions are visible in the list of on-demand executions in the web UI and retrieved via the [on-demand executions API](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/on-demand-executions#api "Execute synthetic monitors on demand from public or private locations").
4. **Fail on performance threshold violation**âby default, on-demand executions fail when they violate a performance threshold, given that their main purpose is to validate new software versions in your CI/CD pipeline. However, you can disable this setting so that on-demand executions behave like regularly scheduled executions (performance threshold violation does not cause this execution to fail but contributes to triggering the performance problem.).
5. **Trigger screenshot** (for browser monitors only)âfor a successful execution, the system takes a screenshot. To see the screenshot, go to [**Analyze executions**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/browser-monitors-results-reporting#analyze-executions "Learn about the Browser details page for Browser monitors.").

   **SSL issue handling** (for HTTP monitors only)âfail the monitor if one or more of its requests encounters an expired, missing, or expiring SSL certificate.
6. Select  **Trigger now**âsee a summary dialog listing the execution locations; the execution list displays new entries for the triggered executions. The **Execution stage** initially is `Triggered`.

   Any change you make to monitor script (configuration) is immediately available for on-demand executions on public or private locations.

   Note that executions might not all begin at the same time from different locationsâexecutions might take longer to begin from public locations than from private locations. See additional information on [throttling](#throttling) below.

#### Throttling and limits

* There is a mandatory gap per user of 60 seconds between consecutive on-demand executions of a monitor from the same location (whether triggered via the web UI or API).

  Examples of throttling

  All these examples assume execution from the same location.

  + User A triggers a monitor via API within 60 seconds of triggering the same monitor via UIâthrottled.
  + User B triggers a monitor via API within 60 seconds of user A triggering the same monitor via UIâno throttling.
  + User B triggers a monitor via UI within 60 seconds of user A triggering the same monitor via UIâno throttling.
  + User B triggers a monitor via API within 60 seconds of user A triggering the same monitor via APIâno throttling.
* When triggering multiple on-demand executions via the [API](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/on-demand-executions#api "Execute synthetic monitors on demand from public or private locations"), there is a limit of 100 executions per batch.
* + There's a limit of 5,000 on-demand executions per minute for a Dynatrace environment.
* You can define up to 64 key-value pairs of metadata per batch, where keys and values can each be up to 1,024 characters.

#### Failure to be triggered

On-demand executions might not be successfully triggered for various reasons, for example, when a monitor is disabled, a location is down, or when throttling is in effect for a monitor on a given location.

Additional reasons that on-demand executions might not be successfully triggered via the [API](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/on-demand-executions#api "Execute synthetic monitors on demand from public or private locations"): monitor deletion, incorrect specification of monitor or location IDs, incorrect specification of related service or application IDs, location deletion, problems with the public Synthetic infrastructure, or problems with your Dynatrace monitoring environment.

If an execution can't be successfully triggered via the web UI, the reasons are shown in the **Triggering status summary** after you select  **Trigger now**. The **Execution stage** in the execution list is `Not triggered`. Details of executions not triggered via the [API](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/on-demand-executions#api "Execute synthetic monitors on demand from public or private locations") are returned in the `triggeringProblemsCount` and `triggeringProblemsDetails` response parameters for the POST request.

Executions that can't be triggered are different from executions that are triggered but can't be executed. For details, see the [API](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/on-demand-executions#api "Execute synthetic monitors on demand from public or private locations") section.

#### List of executions

The list of executions shows all on-demand executions (triggered by any user via the web UI or API) for a given monitor within the selected time frame.

You need the DPS license to see the list of executions.

* **Execution ID** is a unique ID assigned to each execution; if you trigger executions from all locations, each location's execution has a different ID.
* **Triggered** shows the start time of the execution in the logged-in user's time zone.
* **Source** shows whether the execution was triggered via the web `UI` or the `API`.
* **User** is the Dynatrace user ID of the user who triggered the execution.
* **Location** is the name of the public or private location from which the monitor was executed.
* **Execution stage** identifies the different stages of the on-demand execution. The initial value is `Triggered` or `Not triggered`. When execution is complete, the value changes to `Executed`. Basic results such as duration and status code are available at this stage. The progress spinner continues to be displayed at the `Executed` stage until detailed results are available and the value changes to `Data retrieved`. If multiple sequential executions are triggered per location, the first execution is marked `Triggered`; the remaining executions are marked `Waiting`.
* **Result** indicates whether the execution was a `Success` or `Failure` (with an accompanying **Failure reason**).
* To view execution details, select the expand icon  in the first column.

# Private synthetic locations

# Private synthetic locations

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Updated on Dec 22, 2025

The goal of private locations is to execute synthetic monitors. You need to use private locations to monitor applications and endpoints within corporate networks, which are unavailable from the public internet. Also, private locations are obligatory for executing [NAM](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-a-nam-monitor-synthetic-app "Learn how to set up a NAM monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.") monitors.

With monitors executed from a private location, you can bring the testing capabilities available in public locations right into your own environment. With private locations you can:

* Measure internal webpage performance and availability.
* Measure complex internal applications with browser clickpaths.
* Measure external resources with synthetic monitors run from internal locations.
* Monitor APIs, both internal and external.

You can create only classic locations using ![Synthetic Classic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-512-83ec796e54.png "Synthetic Classic") **Synthetic**, although the locations list displays classic and containerized (for example, Kubernetes and OpenShift) locations. If you still need to create a containerized location, you can do it in [Settings Classic](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location#add "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring.").

The **Private locations** tab in ![Synthetic Classic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-512-83ec796e54.png "Synthetic Classic") **Synthetic** shows the list of all private locations available within a given environment. For each private location, there's information about how many synthetic monitors are assigned to it, with links to those monitors.

If you created a private location in previous Dynatrace, it remains available in latest Dynatraceâthere's no need to redeploy it.

## System and hardware requirements for private locations

Make sure the target host you plan to use for running synthetic monitors complies with [system and hardware requirements for private Synthetic locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/requirements-for-private-synthetic "Check system and hardware requirements for private Synthetic locations."). Note that Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates have more demanding hardware and system requirements than a regular Environment or Cluster ActiveGate.

Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate installed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and 22.04 LTS only You can use [`TEMP`](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/installation/linux/linux-customize-installation-for-activegate#temporary "Learn about the command-line parameters that you can use with ActiveGate on Linux.") to customize the [default temporary directory for private Synthetic files](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/configuration/where-can-i-find-activegate-files#default-activegate-directories--linux "Find out where ActiveGate files are stored on Windows and Linux systems.")â`/var/tmp/dynatrace/synthetic`. However, the path must begin with `/var/tmp`, for example, `TEMP=/var/tmp/syn`. Dynatrace requires write access to `/var/tmp` for the installation of Chromium snap packages.

End-of-support information

There are no new versions of Chromium for Red Hat/Oracle Linux/Rocky Linux 8 beyond version 133. For important security and stability reasons, we've decided to discontinue our support for installing **Synthetic-enabled** ActiveGate on Red Hat/Oracle Linux/Rocky Linux 8 after ActiveGate version 1.325.

To ensure the continuity and security of your synthetic monitors, we recommend migrating your Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate to one of the [supported operating systems](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/system-and-hardware-requirements-for-private-synthetic#linux-supported-os "Supported operating systems, Chromium versions, and hardware requirements for running synthetic monitors from private locations"), for example, Red Hat/Oracle Linux/Rocky Linux 9.

ActiveGate version 1.325 is **the last Synthetic-enabled** ActiveGate supported on Red Hat/Oracle Linux/Rocky Linux 8.

Additionally, with Dynatrace version 1.326, we plan to introduce mechanisms preventing Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates on Red Hat/Oracle Linux/Rocky Linux 8 from being updated beyond version 1.325.

Additional support notes

* Chromium development for Amazon Linux 2 stopped at version 126.
  For important security and stability reasons, we've decided to discontinue our support for installing Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate on Amazon Linux 2 after ActiveGate version 1.307.
  ActiveGate version 1.307 is the last Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate to support Amazon Linux 2.
  Additionally, with Dynatrace version 1.308, we have introduced mechanisms preventing Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates on Amazon Linux 2 from being updated beyond version 1.307.
* Chromium development for Red Hat/CentOS 7 stopped at version 126.
  For important security and stability reasons, we've decided to discontinue our support for installing Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate on Red Hat/CentOS 7 after ActiveGate version 1.305.
  ActiveGate version 1.305 is the last Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate to support Red Hat/CentOS 7.
  Additionally, with Dynatrace version 1.306, we have introduced mechanisms preventing Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates on Red Hat/CentOS 7 from being updated beyond version 1.305.

  + Since Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 reached [End of Maintenanceï»¿](https://dt-url.net/af03uea) support on June 30, 2024, all of its packages have been archived. This means that it may not be possible to find the required dependencies for update. For more details, see the [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 statusï»¿](https://dt-url.net/e623zr1)
* Check the latest [ActiveGate release notes](/docs/whats-new/activegate "Release notes for Dynatrace ActiveGate") for the oldest supported ActiveGate versions.

### Before you begin

* You cannot execute synthetic monitors using an Environment ActiveGate configured for [multi-environment support](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/configuration/configure-an-environment-activegate-for-multi-environment-support "Read the step-by-step procedure for configuring a single Environment ActiveGate for multi-environment support.").
* You can create a private location using a clean-installed Synthetic-enabled Environment ActiveGate version 1.169+ or Cluster ActiveGate with Dynatrace Managed version 1.176+. If you want to use an existing ActiveGate host, [uninstall ActiveGate](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/operation/uninstall-activegate "Learn how to remove ActiveGate from Windows or Linux-based systems.") first.
* Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate is used exclusively to run synthetic monitors. A clean ActiveGate installation for the purpose of synthetic monitoring disables all other ActiveGate features, including communication with OneAgents.

* Only IPv4 and DNS UDP are supported for network configuration.

* Both manual and automatic Chromium updates require access to `https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com`. For security reasons, public access to the S3 bucket is enabled only for specific files; trying anything else will result in a 403 error.

## Create a private location

To add a classic private location

1. Go to the **Private locations** tab in the upper-left corner of the ![Synthetic Classic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-512-83ec796e54.png "Synthetic Classic") **Synthetic** home page.
2. Select  **New private locations**  > **Classic**.
3. Name your location.
4. Map it from an existing geographic location or add a custom location defined by **Country**, **Region**, **City**, **Latitude**, and **Longitude**.
5. Select **Existing ActiveGate** to add an existing Synthetic-enabled Activegate to the location or **Deploy new ActiveGate** to deploy a new one (deploying a new ActiveGate will redirect you to [![Discovery & Coverage](https://dt-cdn.net/images/discovery-coverage-256-a20d5afa78.png "Discovery & Coverage") **Discovery & Coverage**](/docs/ingest-from/discovery-coverage-app "Discover and remediate monitoring coverage gaps at scale.") from where you can [install an ActiveGate](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/active-gate-for-private-locations-install "Learn how to install Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates.")).

   Add multiple ActiveGates if you plan to run a large number of synthetic monitors.
   Additional ActiveGates are used for failover and load balancing.

   * We recommend using at least two ActiveGates for a location.
   * You can't use one ActiveGate for multiple locations.

6. Optional Turn on **Enable Chromium auto-update**âit will be triggered during the Synthetic engine updates at this location.

   You can **Enable Chromium auto-update** at the location level, that is, for all ActiveGates assigned to a private location. Chromium autoupdate takes place during manual as well as automatic ActiveGate and Synthetic engine updates.

   As we recommend using the [latest supported Chromium version](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/requirements-for-private-synthetic#chromium-linux "Check system and hardware requirements for private Synthetic locations.") for the smooth and secure execution of browser monitors from your private location, Chromium autoupdate is turned on by default for locations with Linux-based ActiveGates. If you don't want Chromium to be updated automatically, for example, to use a specific version of Chromium, or if you have offline environments, turn off the switch **before triggering an ActiveGate update**.

   This setting only applies to Linux-based ActiveGates; on Windows-based ActiveGates, Chromium is always updated during Synthetic engine updates. If your location has only Windows-based ActiveGates, the toggle is turned on but grayed out.

   Successful Chromium autoupdate requires access to OS (system) repositories for Chromium dependencies and access to `https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com` for Chromium components. If you've enabled a [custom local repository](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/install-chromium-for-linux#custom-repo "Learn how to install Chromium for Linux manually and from custom repositories."), Chromium components (but not dependencies) need to be available at the specified HTTP server address. See [Chromium autoupdate from a custom repository](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/install-chromium-for-linux#autoupdate-custom-repo "Learn how to install Chromium for Linux manually and from custom repositories.").

   You will see a message if Chromium autoupdate fails for this or other reasonsâwe recommend either meeting the requirements for autoupdate (such as access to repositories) or disabling Chromium autoupdate for your private location.

   * We strongly recommend that you keep your Linux-based Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates and Chromium versions updatedâDynatrace supports Chromium versions that are no more than two versions behind the [latest Dynatrace-supported version](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/requirements-for-private-synthetic#chromium-linux "Check system and hardware requirements for private Synthetic locations.") for a specific ActiveGate release. If you don't opt for Chromium autoupdate, you can [update Chromium manually](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/install-chromium-for-linux#chromium-manual "Learn how to install Chromium for Linux manually and from custom repositories.").
   * If you disable Chromium autoupdate, you can [manually update Chromium](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/install-chromium-for-linux#chromium-manual "Learn how to install Chromium for Linux manually and from custom repositories.") per ActiveGate. However, Chromium autoupdate is required when using [custom repositories](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/install-chromium-for-linux#custom-repo "Learn how to install Chromium for Linux manually and from custom repositories."). See [Chromium autoupdate from a custom repository](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/install-chromium-for-linux#autoupdate-custom-repo "Learn how to install Chromium for Linux manually and from custom repositories.").
   * Autoupdate works to update Chromium to the latest version that Dynatrace provides for an ActiveGate release. In some cases, this might be different from the [latest Dynatrace-supported Chromium version](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/requirements-for-private-synthetic#chromium-linux "Check system and hardware requirements for private Synthetic locations.") for the ActiveGate release.

   Also, check our information on [installing Chromium and other dependencies manually (Linux only)](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/install-chromium-for-linux#manual "Learn how to install Chromium for Linux manually and from custom repositories.").
7. Optional If you have outage issues with your private location, use the **Location outage handling** options to receive related notifications. See the on-screen instructions for details.

   * You can configure the location to generate a problem when the entire private location is unavailable (all ActiveGates are offline), or if the location lacks the capability required for the monitor type to be executed.
   * You can configure the location to generate a problem when a single ActiveGate at this location is offline.

   For example, suppose your location has two ActiveGates, and you enable both problem switches. You will see three problems when your location is unavailableâone for the entire location and one for each ActiveGate that's offline.

   Containerized locations

   For containerized locations, you can only generate a problem when the entire private location is unavailable (all ActiveGates are offline), or if the location lacks the capability required for the monitor type to be executed.
8. Select **Save**.

## Additional deployment modes

Additional deployment modes available to you

* Browserless
* Kerberos
* FIPS compliant

### Browserless Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate

In general, we recommend the deployment of Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate to support the execution of all types synthetic monitors (HTTP, browser, NAM).

If you don't need to execute browser monitors, however, you might want to consider deploying your node in a special browserless mode. Such a node will be deployed without the browser. The resulting deployment requires less hardware resources, but browser monitors cannot be executed from such a node.

Consider browserless nodes as an alternative to nodes with browser monitor support when you're focused purely on:

* Network and infrastructure use cases (using NAM monitors)
* API monitoring (using HTTP monitors)

### Kerberos client setup

If you want to run browser monitors using Kerberos authentication, the private location should be configured to be able to get ticket from the Kerberos Key Distribution Center.

Windows

Linux

1. Each Windows machine using Kerberos has to be properly configured with Active Directory.
2. If you are unable to authenticate with Kerberos on Windows, use the following command to register the machine.

```
ksetup /addkdc DOMAIN.TO.ADD address.of.kerberos.server
```

The `DOMAIN.TO.ADD` is your domain name and `address.of.kerberos.server` is the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (Active Directory Controller if you're using a Microsoft solution). Note that in the credentials used, the domain name must be in uppercase (for example, user@EXAMPLE.COM).

Synthetic uses Kerberos authentication by executing the `kinit` command. For details, see [MIT Kerberos Documentation - kinitï»¿](https://dt-url.net/pr43wj6).

A Linux private location has to be properly configured to be able to get a ticket from the Kerberos Key Distribution Center. Make sure that the location has the following:

* Installed packages for Kerberos client (workstation).
* Properly configured `/etc/krb5.conf` file (or configuration file specified by `KRB5_CONFIG` environment variable).

The configuration is dependent on the Linux distribution. You can find more information in the official documentation.

* Ubuntu:

  + `sudo apt install krb5-user`
  + More information: [Ubuntu Server Documentation - How to set up basic workstation authenticationï»¿](https://dt-url.net/3g03w9p)
* Red Hat/Rocky:

  + `yum install krb5-workstation krb5-libs`
  + More information: [Red Hat Documentation - Configuring a Kerberos Clientï»¿](https://dt-url.net/1u23wq7)

### Synthetic FIPS compliance

ActiveGate version 1.315+

#### Installation

To install Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate in FIPS compliant mode, you need to add the `--fips-mode` flag. See also [customize ActiveGate installation for FIPS compliance](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/installation/linux/linux-customize-installation-for-activegate#fips-compliant-mode "Learn about the command-line parameters that you can use with ActiveGate on Linux.").

```
/bin/bash ./Dynatrace-ActiveGate-Linux.sh --enable-synthetic --fips-mode
```

Please note that FIPS-compliant mode cannot be changed after installation. To change the mode, you need to uninstall ActiveGate and reinstall it with the desired settings.
Additionally, if you intend to execute browser monitors, additional setup will be required as described in [Proxy configuration for FIPS mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/proxy-for-private-locations#fips-proxy "Learn how to manage proxies for private Synthetic locations.") and [Proxy configuration for FIPS mode with corporate proxy](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/proxy-for-private-locations#fips-corporate-proxy "Learn how to manage proxies for private Synthetic locations.").

#### Requirements and limitations

* We require operating system with FIPS-compliant mode enabled, see also [ActiveGate FIPS compliance](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/activegate-fips-compliance "Learn about ActiveGate FIPS compliance").
* Following operating systems are currently supported:

  + Ubuntu Pro 22.04
  + Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9
* Private Synthetic locations on Kubernetes are not supported at the moment.

#### Ensuring compliance

To ensure the browser monitor traffic is FIPS compliant, it must be routed through a local intercepting proxy that encrypts traffic with a FIPS-certified crypto library. See [Proxy configuration for FIPS mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations#fips-proxy "Learn how to manage private locations in the Synthetic app.") for details.

For HTTP monitors, we use the [Amazon Corretto Crypto Providerï»¿](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider/) FIPS-certified cryptographic library that uses AWS-LC-FIPS 2.x as its cryptographic module. See [Certificate #4816ï»¿](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/4816).

Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate in FIPS compliant mode supports the same set of cipher suites as [regular ActiveGate](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/activegate-fips-compliance#supported-cipher-suites "Learn about ActiveGate FIPS compliance").

## FAQ

How can I verify the authenticity of downloaded Chrome(-ium) packages?

Chromium

Chrome for Testing

Each `tgz` package archive is stored in the S3 bucket together with the `*.tgz.sig` signature file. To verify if the packages on your drive are authentic Dynatrace-provided archives:

1. Download the signature file. The filename is identical to the package archive but has the `sig` filename extension. For example, for Chromium 140, the command is:

   ```
   curl --output chromium.tgz.sig https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/Chromium/rpm/chromium-140.0.7339.185-1.el9.tgz.sig
   ```
2. Verify the package:

   ```
   wget https://ca.dynatrace.com/dt-root.cert.pem ; openssl cms



   -verify



   -in chromium.tgz.sig



   -inform PEM



   -content chromium.tgz



   -binary



   -CAfile dt-root.cert.pem > /dev/null
   ```
3. Verify the signature timestamp.

   You can also get the exact timestamp of a signature. Download the `*.tgz.sig.tsr` file from the same location as the installation packages and signature, and then run the following command:

   ```
   openssl ts -reply -in chromium.tgz.sig.tsr -text
   ```

Each `zip` package archive is stored in the S3 bucket together with the `*.zip.sig` signature file. To verify if the packages on your drive are authentic Dynatrace-provided archives:

1. Download the signature file. The filename is identical to the package archive but has the `sig` filename extension. For example, for Chrome for Testing 141.0.7390.122, the command is:

   ```
   curl --output chrome.zip.sig https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/Chrome/chrome-for-testing-linux64/chrome-for-testing-linux64-141.0.7390.122.zip.sig
   ```
2. Verify the package:

   ```
   wget https://ca.dynatrace.com/dt-root.cert.pem ; openssl cms



   -verify



   -in chrome.zip.sig



   -inform PEM



   -content chrome.zip



   -binary



   -CAfile dt-root.cert.pem > /dev/null
   ```
3. Verify the signature timestamp.

   You can also get the exact timestamp of a signature. Download the `*.zip.sig.tsr` file from the same location as installation packages and signature and run the following command:

   ```
   openssl ts -reply -in chrome.zip.sig.tsr -text
   ```

Can I use a proxy with the Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate?

With ActiveGate version 1.175+, an ActiveGate executing synthetic monitors can connect through the proxy to both the Dynatrace Cluster and the tested resource. For more information, see [Setting up proxy for private synthetic monitoring](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/setting-up-proxy-for-private-synthetic "Learn how to configure ActiveGate properties to set up a proxy for private synthetic monitoring.").

Can I update an earlier ActiveGate to version 1.169+ and configure it to use with private synthetic monitors?

No, you need to run a clean installation specifically for the purpose of synthetic monitoring to enable your ActiveGate to execute monitors from private locations.

Can I turn on Synthetic on an existing ActiveGate installation?

Private Synthetic locations require a clean installation of ActiveGate specifically for the purpose of synthetic monitoring.

Manually editing the `custom.properties` file is not enough to enable the ActiveGate to execute synthetic monitors.

# HTTP monitors reporting results

# HTTP monitors reporting results

* Latest Dynatrace
* Reference
* 15-min read
* Updated on Nov 03, 2025

The HTTP monitors reporting results page provides an overview panel of monitor execution results, result visualizations, and monitor properties. The details panel shows you at-a-glance information and graphs, with ready links and filters to drill right down to problem details and edit monitor settings.

To access the HTTP monitors reporting results page,

1. Go to ![Synthetic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-new-256-1ddb35ac79.png "Synthetic") **Synthetic**.
2. Optional Select **HTTP** on the left to filter the list for HTTP monitors.
3. From the list of HTTP monitors, select the monitor you want to examine.
4. Select **View details** from the preview panel to access the details page.

![HTTP Monitor Reporting - Top](https://dt-cdn.net/images/screenshot-2025-06-11-112148-3221-e023915f0e.png)

![HTTP Monitor Reporting - Bottom](https://dt-cdn.net/images/screenshot-2025-06-11-112555-3221-cedecd8ab7.png)

## Metric visualizations

The top panel shows overall monitor [availability](#availability) and [performance](#performance) infographics for the selected timeframe.

Use the  filter bar at the top of the page to filter all HTTP details by one or more locations.

In the upper-right corner of the page, you can access [**Analyze executions**](#analyze-executions), [**On-demand execution**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/on-demand-executions "Learn about how to perform on-demand executions."), and more HTTP monitor settings:

* **Edit**
* for more options ( **Disable** and  **Delete**)

### Analyze executions

DPS License

If you're a non-DPS user, see [HTTP monitors reporting results (classic)](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/synthetic-details-for-http-monitors-classic#analyze-last-execution "Learn about the Synthetic details page for HTTP monitors (classic).").

When you access **Analyze executions** functionality, you're presented with the **Select execution** section with the scatter plot chart on which you can move the view window to the next or previous 50 executions. For readability, the whole chart is limited to 100 points. The content of the scatter plot chart might be divided into results (success/failure), locations, or all of those dimensions. Therefore, you can analyze your executions in three ways:

* **Split by status**âthe default view shows **Healthy** and **Failed** executions separately. Below the graph, there's a legend where you can select any status to focus the graph on it. Select  icon for more options.
* **Split by location**âshows executions performed from different locations. Below the graph, there's a legend where you can select a given location to focus the graph on it. Select  icon for more options.
* **Split by both**âcombines the **Split by status** and **Split by location** views.

  Note that if there's more than one execution status for the location, the legend below the graph presents the location more than once. For example, `Las Vegas (Healthy)` and `Las Vegas (Failed)`.

Not only can you see the details of the last failed or successful execution, but also the details of all executions within the retention period.

![Analyze executions view](https://dt-cdn.net/images/analyze-executions-3022-c395fceee3.png)

* Each dot represents a separate execution. You can select any dot, hover over the data, and select **Analyze execution** to display the execution's details in the panel below.
* You can narrow down the displayed details to a needed set of elements using filters visible on the left in the **Visible parts** section.
* You can also select two executions for comparison. To do that

  1. Select an execution and hover over their data visible in the tooltip. Then, select **Analyze execution**.
  2. Select the second execution you want to compare the first with. Hover over their data visible in the tooltip and select **Compare execution**.

  You'll see the following comparison:

  ![Synthetic HTTP compare execution](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-http-responses-comparison-1914-2d38bd9eac.png)

On-demand executions

You can trigger an execution on-demand. For details, see [On-demand monitor executions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/on-demand-executions "Learn about how to perform on-demand executions.").

## Availability

The Availability section displays the monitor's availability for the selected timeframe, with details of downtime and affected locations, if any. The panel contains information about all problems related to the given monitor. Outage (downtime) duration and affected locations infographics are displayed if the monitor is down (unavailable) at one or more locations.

Also, the panel shows reasons for discarded tests. The bar above the time frame indicates when a downtime occurred. Hover over the bar to see why the tests were discarded. The possible reasons can be:

* **Maintenance window** - the monitor execution was deliberately [made inactive](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/notifications-and-alerting/maintenance-windows/define-maintenance-window#disable-synthetic "Create maintenance windows and define their scope.") due to maintenance. For details, see the maintenance window.

  How to see the maintenance window, and what happens if the monitor execution is on/off

  To see the maintenance window:

  1. Select the bar to pin the **Maintenance window** tooltip.
  2. Hover over the **Maintenance window** tooltip.
  3. Select **View maintenance window settings**.
  4. Select **Settings Classic**.

  + When the **Disable synthetic monitor execution** option is on in the maintenance window, the tests are suppressed during the maintenance period so there are no tests results for this period.
  + When the **Disable synthetic monitor execution** option is on in the maintenance window, the scheduled automatic tests are suppressed during the maintenance period, but the [on-demand](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/on-demand-executions "Execute synthetic monitors on demand from public or private locations") tests are not suppressed.
  + When the **Disable synthetic monitor execution** option is off in the maintenance window, the tests are executed during the maintenance period, but, due to maintenance, the test results may differ from those observed under the normal conditions.

* **No result** - the execution started but the results were not delivered. Reach out to the Dynatrace support team.
* **No capability** - you're trying to execute monitors that aren't supported by a location (for example, NAM ICMP monitors - from a location with inactive ICMP).
* **Discarded, not executed** - the probable cause is the overloaded private location. Check the capacity metrics. If there are no issues with the metrics, contact the Dynatrace support team.
* **Http monitor local outage** - the outage happened in one or more locations from which the monitor executed the tests.
* **Http monitor global outage** - the outage happened in all locations from which the monitor executed the tests.

  Local and global outage - view problem details

  To see the details of the problem that's causing the local or global outage:

  1. Select the bar with the  icon to pin the **Http monitor local outage** or **Http monitor global outage** tooltip.
  2. Hover over the tooltip.
  3. Select  **View problem details**.
  4. Select one of the available options:

     + **Problems Classic**
     + **Problems** in the problems app
     + **Problems** in the current app to view problem details.

A monitor can be down at one or all locations even if no [outage thresholds (global or local)](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-and-configure-an-http-monitor#outage-and-performance "Learn how to set up and edit an HTTP monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.") have been set up. The outage duration is the sum of all downtimes in the selected timeframe, not counting overlapping downtimes.

The **Availability** card shows overall availability across all monitor locations, with annotations for global/local outages and global/local missing data (as when the monitor is inactive).

### Availability calculation

Availability metrics are calculated by dividing the number of successful executions ("up") by the total number of executions. Thus, to calculate availability

1. Determine the number of up executions within the timeframe.

   This is the total number of executions within the timeframe, minus the number of failed ("down") executions within the timeframe.
2. Determine availability.

   Divide the number of up executions by the total number of executions, and then multiply by 100 to get a percentage.

**Example**

Suppose we have 5 down executions within a 35-minute timeframe.

* Total executions = `35`
* Down executions = `5`
* Up executions = `35-5 = 30`
* Availability = `(30/35) \* 100 = 0.8571 \* 100` = `85.71 percent`

#### Exclude maintenance period executions from metrics calculations

You can set up a [maintenance window](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/notifications-and-alerting/maintenance-windows "Understand when to use a maintenance window. Read about the supported maintenance window types.") so [test executions are not suppressed](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/notifications-and-alerting/maintenance-windows/define-maintenance-window#disable-synthetic "Create maintenance windows and define their scope.") during maintenance periods. Then, if outages happen during the maintenance period, down executions are included in the metrics calculations.

In the example below, the availability is less than 100% because the down executions are included in the metric calculation by default.

```
timeseries avg(dt.synthetic.http.availability), by:{dt.entity.http_check, dt.maintenance_window_ids, interpolated}



| filter dt.entity.http_check == "HTTP_CHECK-2F280898D4FCB1A8"
```

Run in Playground

![Availability with included maintenance period executions](https://dt-cdn.net/images/a40863a4-4a5d-4380-8ef8-7d8353639756-1179-34988a102e.png)

To exclude the maintenance period executions from the metric calculation

1. Add the `dt.maintenance_window_ids` dimension to the query.
2. Filter the executions that are not covered by the maintenance window with `isNull(dt.maintenance_window_ids)`.

In the example below, we have down executions detected during the maintenance period, but they were not included into the calculation metric due to we used the `dt.maintenance_window_ids` dimension, and the `isNull(dt.maintenance_window_ids)` filter condition.

```
timeseries av = avg(dt.synthetic.http.availability), by: {dt.entity.http_check, dt.maintenance_window_ids}



| filter dt.entity.http_check == "HTTP_CHECK-2F280898D4FCB1A8"



| filter isNull(dt.maintenance_window_ids)



| fields avgAV=arrayAvg(av)
```

Run in Playground

![Example use of dt.maintenance_window_ids](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dem-3738-1179-248a06b401.png)

#### Interpolation

The approach described above requires all executions to happen at the same rate. However, in a real-world environment this is not always the case as the monitor execution frequency may change or additional on-demand executions may be triggered.

To make the calculation more accurate, the interpolation mechanism is introduced: the total monitoring time is divided into minute-level data points. All data points count as executions, although they don't necessarily coincide with actual executions.

On the screen below, the blue data points coincide with actual executions, and the white data points don't.

![Up/down interpolated data points](https://dt-cdn.net/images/screenshot-2025-06-05-142009-1552-ea3432b75b.png)

Let's imagine a monitor is set to execute tests every five minutes. So, every fifth data point (blue) coincides with an actual execution. All data points following the first down execution and preceding the first up execution count as "down." Thus, when calculating the availability metrics, the number of down executions is calculated as follows:

Down executions = the first actual down execution + all following "down" data points.

### Open in Notebooks

DPS License

Through the Availability section, you can also access **Notebooks** ![Notebooks](https://dt-cdn.net/images/notebooks-768-046137830a.webp "Notebooks") with three predefined DQL queries which are executed to get data from Synthetic events in Grail.

Note that queries for synthetic events from outside the Synthetic application, such as those from **Notebooks** ![Notebooks](https://dt-cdn.net/images/notebooks-768-046137830a.webp "Notebooks"), **Dashboards** ![Dashboards](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-512-b1f1e9690b.png "Dashboards"), and **SRG** ![Site Reliability Guardian](https://dt-cdn.net/images/site-reliability-guardian-ec19b393a6.svg "Site Reliability Guardian"), are **not** charged.

The predefined queries are examples of how to deal with synthetic monitor execution details using our Dynatrace Query Language. You can use those queries as patterns and adjust them to your needs.

* Query number 1âreturns an executions list of the selected monitors within the selected time range. For each execution, the query returns a timestamp, basic information about the result, and an ID.
* Query number 2âby default contains the filter applied to the last execution from the list mentioned above and returns details of each executed step of the monitor.
* Query number 3âreturns full details of an HTTP monitor execution, including the whole request and response.

## Performance

The performance section displays the HTTP monitor's performanceâresponse time for the sum of all requests across all locations for the selected timeframe. We don't do sum operation for executions from different locations.

Additional metrics are captured per request and are shown in the [requests card](#http-requests).

**Performance** card shows trend lines for response time for the execution time for the whole monitor with the shaded area representing the difference between the two values at any given time. Note that if your monitor runs from a single location, the minimum and maximum trend lines coincide.

Optional You can view trend lines for the HTTP monitor's performance.

### Display problems in Performance section

* Red bar above the chart indicates an ongoing problem.
* Grey bar above the chart indicates a closed problem.

Availability and other problems are not marked in this section.

If the monitor violates a [performance threshold](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-and-configure-an-http-monitor#outage-and-performance "Learn how to set up and edit an HTTP monitor to check the performance and availability of your site."), whether for the sum of all requests or an individual request, a solid red line appears above the performance graph for the problem duration. Select the solid red bar to display a link to the problem overview page.

View problem details

1. Hover over the problem bar to see an ongoing/closed problem details in the form of a tooltip.
2. Select the problem bar and hover over the tooltip to display more options.
3. Select  **View problem details** to open the problem details in Problems ![Problems app - new](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dynatrace-davis-new-256-340162f8c6.webp "Problems app - new").

## Problems

The **Problems** card shows performance (threshold violation) and availability (local or global outage) problems when you enable the respective thresholds in [monitor settings](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-and-configure-an-http-monitor#outage-and-performance "Learn how to set up and edit an HTTP monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.").

See [Create and configure an HTTP monitor](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-and-configure-an-http-monitor "Learn how to set up and edit an HTTP monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.") for information on defining performance and thresholds availability outage rules. See the [Synthetic alerting overview](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/synthetic-alerting-overview "Learn about synthetic alerting concepts and workflow.") for alerting workflow and concepts, including setting up notification profiles and templates.

There are three main problem types for HTTP monitors:

* Global outage (availability)
* Local outage (availability)
* Performance threshold violation (performance problem for sum of all requests or individual requests)

Performance problems may combine threshold violations at the monitor as well as request levels.

The problems section lists all problems in the selected time frame, both open and closed. On top of that, you can:

* See the details of a problem in the form of a table with a start date and duration.
* Expand each problem to see affected entities and alerting profiles.

Problems, along with their constituent [events](#events) and any corresponding [status codes](#http-requests) give you a full picture of the number and scope of your monitor's issues.

## HTTP requests

An HTTP monitor can consist of one or multiple HTTP requests. The **HTTP requests** card overviews all executed requests, their order, name, request URL, and the HTTP method used. For each request, the **HTTP requests** card splits performance (**Response time**) by the following metrics (see more in [HTTP monitor metrics](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/http-monitor-metrics-classic "Learn about the performance metrics collected for HTTP monitors (classic).")):

* **DNS lookup time**
* **TCP connect time**
* **TLS handshake time**
* **Waiting**
* **Download**

**Response time** is the summation of these different metrics.

Expand a request from the list to view all performance metrics in one chart. Select a metric in the legend to remove/add it to the performance chart. Select **Edit request** to go to monitor settings from this card.

The **Status codes** tab shows the timeline of returned HTTP status codes for a particular request. (The [HTTP status codes card](#status-codes) shows the returned HTTP status codes for your HTTP monitor as a whole.)

When a request violates its [event-specific performance threshold](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-and-configure-an-http-monitor#outage-and-performance "Learn how to set up and edit an HTTP monitor to check the performance and availability of your site."), it is highlighted in red. Expand the request to see the performance timings and the threshold violated. A solid red line for the problem duration appears above the stacked graph; the request threshold appears as a dotted red line. Select the solid red bar to display a link to the problem overview page.

## Errors

The **Errors** card displays errors found in the selected time frame.

The Problems section lists all problems, both open and closed. On top of that, you can:

* See the details of an error in the form of a table with the request and number of occurrences.
* Select **Analyze errors**  for an in-depth error analysis.

## Response size

The **Response size** card shows trend lines for minimum and maximum response size for the sum of all requests, with any shaded area representing the difference between the two values at any given time. The trend lines might coincide, as when your monitor runs from a single location. However, response size might vary, for example, when different responses are sent based on location.

To track such differences, you can **Show response size breakdown per location**. Note that if you filter the entire details page by any locations, the toggle is no longer available.

## Events

The **Events** card shows all events that compose problems. Events for active as well as resolved problems show up in the list and timeline.

Hover over a time slot in the event timeline to see the type and number of events generated at that interval. Select a time slot to view a tooltip with the events that took place in it.

Select an event type, for example, **HTTP monitor location slowdown**, to see the list of events. One slowdown event is always created per location where your monitor violates request- or monitor-level performance thresholds. Select an individual event to see details.

The [`api.fail()` method](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/pre-and-post-scripting-for-http-monitors-classic#end "Learn how to apply pre and post scripts to your requests") can be used to define a custom **Failure message** that appears in the Events card in case of failure. Custom log messages also appear in the `customLogs` attribute in [HTTP monitor execution details](#analyze-last-execution).

## Properties and tags

This informational card shows the number of steps, locations, frequency of monitor execution, and any applied tags.

Select  **Edit** to edit or apply additional tags.

## Changes

The **Changes** card shows the history log that displays:

* When the monitor was created and who created it.
* Who changed the monitor properties, when the change was made, and which properties were changed in the selected timeframe.

## Frontends

The **Frontends** card displays the frontends to which the monitor is assigned.

## Services

The **Services** card displays any monitored services automatically associated with the HTTP monitor. This card appears when the monitored HTTP endpoint is hosted on a OneAgent-monitored host, and the endpoint URL is handled by one of the discovered services. The association between the HTTP monitor and the service is made based on data provided by OneAgent. Therefore, at least one monitor execution needs to be completed before a service can be associated with the monitor.

Select the link for a displayed service to view the service overview page, filtered by the HTTP monitor.

### View traces

In HTTP monitors that have associated services, you can see:

* A full list of traces for an entire monitor within a specific period of time
* A full list of traces for a specific service within a specific period of time
* Traces for specific synthetic executions

#### Traces for an entire monitor

To see a full list of traces for an entire monitor, select **View traces** in either of these locations:

* The top of the monitor's details page
* The **Services** card header

#### Traces for a specific service

To see a full list of traces for a specific service

1. In the **Services** card, find a service you want to investigate.
2. Select the  icon in the **View traces** column.

![Traces for a specific service](https://dt-cdn.net/images/screenshot-2025-05-28-104143-910-bad89d821e.png)

#### Traces for a specific execution

To see backed traces for a specific execution

1. Select **Analyze executions** at the top of the monitor's details page.
2. On the graph, select an execution to pin its tooltip.
3. Hover over the tooltip and select **View traces**.

### Navigation and filtering

The synthetic monitors page is the landing page of the ![Synthetic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-new-256-1ddb35ac79.png "Synthetic") **Synthetic** app and is the control center for your synthetic monitors. By default, the page displays all monitors in your environment, active or inactive, in a [table](#table) with key availability and performance results, so you can check the health of your monitors at a glance.
Powerful and flexible [filters](#filters) enable you to narrow your search for synthetic monitors.

To find out how to create a new monitor, see [Create monitors](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app#create-monitors "View the synthetic monitors in your environment, search for monitors, and get a quick overview of a selected monitor.").

### Monitors table

By default, monitors with open problems (issues) are displayed alphabetically at the top of the table. Next, enabled monitors with no problems are displayed alphabetically, followed by disabled monitors displayed alphabetically.

You can hide and sort columns in ascending or descending order. Select **Columns** in the top-right corner of the table to select which columns to display or hide.

Pagination controls at the bottom of the monitor table allow you to specify the number of **rows per page** and to move through the monitor table from page to page.

The columns display the following information for each monitor.

* **Monitor name**âSelect to view a quick overview of the monitor to the right of the Synthetic monitors page
* **Created**âmonitor creation date and time
* **Last modified**âID of the user who last edited the monitor and the date and time of modification
* **ID** - full monitor identifier
* **Last execution**âdate and time of the most recent execution from any location
* **Type**âmonitor type, for example, `HTTP`
* **Frequency**âexecution frequency or `On demand`, as specified in the monitor configuration
* **Availability**âaverage availability during the selected timeframe
* **Duration**âaverage performance during the selected timeframe in seconds

#### Monitor preview

In the ![Synthetic Classic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-512-83ec796e54.png "Synthetic Classic") **Synthetic** app, to display the preview panel for a monitor, select the monitor's name in the **Monitor name** column of the **Synthetic monitors** page.

To browse between your monitors, open the preview panel for any monitor and then select another monitor name to switch the preview to the newly selected monitor. Filters are persistent.

The preview panel shows:

* Tiles for important information at a glance:

  + Outage/Available/No dataâthe monitor availability status at the moment of the last executed test
  + Active issuesâthe number of issues being observed at the moment
  + Affected locationsâthe number of locations where outages happened within specific timeframe
  + Availabilityâthe monitors availability rate in percent within specific timeframe
  + Total downtimeâthe total outage time for all locations within specific timeframe
  + Durationâthe average response time for all locations within specific timeframe
* A list of problems, including the problem start date and duration, or **No problems found**. To analyze a problem in the **Problems** app, select the problem link in the list.
* A list of changes. In latest Dynatrace, this section displays changes to the monitor: when it was changed, who changed it, and what they changed. You can only access changes from a specified timeframe.
* Properties such as monitor type, locations, requests in last execution, frequency, steps, and tags.

Use the controls in the upper-right corner of the preview panel to:

* Edit the selected monitor
* Delete the selected monitor
* Enable a disabled monitor
* Disable an enabled monitor
* Display the reporting page for the selected monitor (see below)
* Close the preview panel

### Filters

Filters allowing multiple selections help you find the monitors you're looking for. You can also save frequently used filters. Expand ![Open Dashboards panel](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-app-dashboards-panel-open-6c03b43117.svg "Open Dashboards panel") or collapse ![Close Dashboards panel](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-app-dashboards-panel-close-78d6b527ad.svg "Close Dashboards panel") the filters to focus on search or results, as required. The filters are automatically collapsed when viewing the quick overview for a monitor.

The following filter categories (each with multiple options) allow you to search for monitors.

* **Type**âmonitor type
* **Ongoing issues**âmonitors with and without availability or performance problems
* **Frontend application**âassociated [RUM](/docs/observe/digital-experience "Optimize end-user experience with Digital Experience Monitoring to ensure application performance and availability across all channels.") application
* **Status**âwhether monitors are active or inactive (disabled)
* **Locations**â[public](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/public-synthetic-locations "Learn about all currently available public Synthetic Monitoring locations.") and [private](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring.") monitoring locations
* **Device profile**âfor example, `desktop`, `Apple iPhone 8`
* **Last editor**âID of the user who last edited a monitor
* **Tags**âvalues or key-value pairs applied to monitors; you can choose tags to include or exclude from your search.
* **Edited during the timeframe**âmonitors that were or were not edited during the selected global timeframe
* **ISP / Cloud provider**âof public Synthetic locations
* **Frequency**âmonitoring frequency

#### How filters work

Within each category, you can select multiple filters. For example, when selecting monitors by **Type**, you can opt to view **HTTP** as well as **DNS** monitors. Within a category, filters are applied using the `OR` logicâmonitors matching any selection are displayed.

The filter options shown in most categories depend on your monitors; only those filters relevant to your monitors are available. For example, if you have no HTTP monitors, you won't see the **HTTP** option to filter by.

The number of monitors matching each filter is displayed. For example, the list of **Locations** shows the number of monitors per location. This number is dynamically adjusted based on your filter selections in other categories.

You can select filters in multiple categories. Filter categories are applied using the `AND` logic. For example, if you select all **Network availability** monitors (**DNS**, **ICMP**, and **TCP**) and two tags, `IP`, and `host-group`, the resulting list contains network availability monitors with either the `IP` or the `host-group` tags.

#### Filter sets

You can save combinations of filters as named filter sets for quick access to frequently used search criteriaâselect **Save new filter** and provide a filter name. You can set one filter set as default to be applied each time you go to the ![Synthetic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-new-256-1ddb35ac79.png "Synthetic") **Synthetic** app.

Select **More** ![More actions](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-app-menu-kebab-c39eda426b.svg "More actions") next to a filter set for additional actions such as **Set as default**, **Rename**, **Duplicate**, or **Delete**.

#### Filter bar

The filter bar ![Variable](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-app-dashboard-add-variable-821b40325c.svg "Variable") at the top of the page displays a fixed filter for searching by monitor name: select **Filter by name** and enter your search string. Any additional filters or [filter sets](#filter-sets) you apply are displayed in the filter bar, from which you can clear applied filters.

### Total downtime calculation for synthetic monitors

The total monitoring time is divided into minute-level data points. All data points count as executions, although they don't necessarily coincide with actual executions.

On the screen below, the blue data points coincide with actual executions, and the white data points don't.

![Up/down executions and data points](https://dt-cdn.net/images/screenshot-2025-07-09-114246-1857-8ed42fbafd.png)

For example, if a monitor is set to execute tests every five minutes, every fifth data point (blue) coincides with an actual execution. All data points following the first failed ("down") execution and preceding the first successful ("up") execution count as "down." Thus, the total downtime is calculated as follows:

Total downtime = the first actual down execution + all following down data points.

# Synthetic Monitoring

# Synthetic Monitoring

* Overview
* 1-min read
* Published Sep 25, 2018

Just because your web application is accessible from your office and runs great on your laptop doesn't mean that your customers around the world are also having a great experience with it. Therefore, it's imperative to ensure constant availability and performance of your application from your users' point of view.

Dynatrace Synthetic Monitoring makes it easy for you to monitor the availability and performance of your applications as experienced by your customers around the world and around the clock. Availability is the success rate at a given instant or time period that indicates if your application is fully functional and available to users. Performance measures whether your web page or recorded interaction experiences significant slowdowns compared to a threshold.

The availability and performance of your internal resources are equally important. With the ability to execute monitors from private locations, you can bring the testing capabilities available in public locations right to your own infrastructure.

Dynatrace offers the following types of synthetic monitors: single-URL browser monitors, browser clickpaths, HTTP monitors and NAM monitors. Check out the links below to learn more. Licensing is based on the [consumption of Synthetic actions and requests](/docs/license "About Dynatrace Platform Subscription (DPS), the licensing model for all Dynatrace capabilities.").

# Synthetic alerting overview

# Synthetic alerting overview

* Latest Dynatrace
* Reference
* 2-min read
* Published Sep 04, 2025

A synthetic monitor creates a [problem](/docs/dynatrace-intelligence "Get familiar with the capabilities of Dynatrace Intelligence.") when one of the following is true:

* A monitored system is not available. In this case, the monitor reports an availability problem. The problem is created after a [specified number of consecutive executions fail](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-and-configure-an-http-monitor#outage-and-performance "Learn how to set up and edit an HTTP monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.").

  A monitored system is considered not available if:

  + The system does not respond.
  + There are certificate issues (in case of browser and HTTP monitors).
  + Constraints are violated (in case of all types of monitors). The constraints can be specified when configuring or editing monitors.
* A specified performance threshold is violated, which means that a monitored system is available but slow. In this case, the monitor reports a performance problem.

## Outage handling and performance thresholds

To set up outage handling and specify performance thresholds, go to ![Synthetic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-new-256-1ddb35ac79.png "Synthetic") **Synthetic**, select your monitor, and then select **Edit**.

Be sure to **Save** to monitor settings.

### Outage handling

In the **Outage handling** section, on the **Outage and performance** tab, you can set up conditions for creating a problem. Two options are available:

* **Generate a problem and send an alert when the monitor is unavailable at all configured locations (global outage)**. You can specify how many consecutive executions must fail so the problem is generated.
* **Generate a problem and send an alert when the monitor is unavailable for one or more consecutive runs at any location** (local outage). You can specify:

  + The minimum number of locations that must be affected so the problem is generated.
  + How many consecutive executions must fail so the problem is generated.

  The option is available only when at least two locations are assigned.

For browser monitors, you can additionally select **Automatic retry on error**âit configures the monitor to avoid false positives by making one more execution after the first one failed. The error is thrown only after the second execution failed.

### Performance threshold for a whole monitor

In the **Performance thresholds** section, on the **Outage and performance** tab, you can specify a performance threshold for a whole monitor. The monitor creates a problem when the sum of the durations of all steps violates this threshold.

Dynatrace generates a new problem if a synthetic monitor exceeds any of the total duration performance thresholds in three of the five most recent executions at a given location, unless there is an open maintenance window for the synthetic monitor. Multiple locations with three such violations can be included in a problem. The problem is closed if no performance threshold is violated in the five most recent executions at each of the previously affected locations.

### Performance thresholds for separate steps

On the **Steps** tab, you can specify performance thresholds for separate steps. The monitor creates a problem when at least one step with a specified threshold violates this threshold.

## Problems

You can monitor problems in:

* [![Problems app - new](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dynatrace-davis-new-256-340162f8c6.webp "Problems app - new") **Problems**](/docs/dynatrace-intelligence/davis-problems-app "Use the Problems app to quickly get to the root cause of incidents in your environment.")
* ![Synthetic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-new-256-1ddb35ac79.png "Synthetic") **Synthetic** itself. Monitors with problems have a red icon in the **Problems** column. The red icon also displays the number of problems for a monitor. From the monitors list, select the monitor whose problems you want to examine. This displays a preview panel on the right. From there you can, for example, select **View details** > **Analyze executions** and investigate executions that detected problems.

# Browser monitors reporting results

# Browser monitors reporting results

* Latest Dynatrace
* Reference
* 15-min read
* Updated on Jan 23, 2026

The browser monitors reporting provides:

* Preview panelâdisplays monitor execution results, problems, errors, and monitor properties. It features at-a-glance information with ready links to drill right down to problem details and edit monitor settings.
* Reporting results pageâdisplays more detailed information including result visualizations like charts and tables that show availability and performance metrics for the monitor in the selected timeframe.
* Analyze executionsâallows you to analyze individual monitor executions in detail.

To display browser monitor results

1. Go to ![Synthetic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-new-256-1ddb35ac79.png "Synthetic") **Synthetic**.
2. Optional To filter the table for browser monitors, select **Browser** under **Filter options** on the left.
3. From the list of browser monitors, select the monitor you want to examine. This displays a preview panel on the right.
4. To access the details page, select **View details** in the upper-right of the preview panel.

![Browser monitor landing page](https://dt-cdn.net/images/screenshot-2025-06-17-180713-3222-29cda17e53.png)

## Metric visualizations

The top panel shows overall monitor availability and performance for the selected timeframe.

Use the  filter bar at the top of the page to filter browser monitor executions by one or more locations.

Under the filter bar, you can see tiles for important information:

* Outage/Available/No dataâthe monitor availability status at the moment of the last executed test.
* Active issuesâthe number of issues being observed at the moment.
* Affected locationsâthe number of locations where outages happened in a specific timeframe.
* Availabilityâthe monitors availability rate in percent in a specific timeframe.
* Total downtimeâthe total outage time for all locations in a specific timeframe.
* Durationâthe average response time for all locations in a specific timeframe.

In the upper-right corner of the page, you can access [**Analyze executions**](#analyze-executions), [**On-demand execution**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/on-demand-executions "Learn about how to perform on-demand executions."), and more browser monitor settings:

* **Edit**
* for more options ( **Disable** and  **Delete**)

## Availability

The **Availability** card displays the monitor's availability for the selected timeframe, either aggregated for all locations or for each location separately. It contains information about all availability problems related to the given monitor, maintenance windows, and unfinished executions. The problems are displayed as bar-shaped [notifications over the availability chart](#notifications_over_availability_charts). They provide the problem details and mark the period when the problem occurred.

Also, if the monitor is down (unavailable) at one or more locations, the outage (downtime) duration and affected locations are displayed in the [metric visualizations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/browser-monitors-results-reporting#metric-visualizations "Learn about the Browser details page for Browser monitors.") above the **Availability** card.

A monitor can be down at one or all locations. Several downtimes may occur in a given timeframe. Their durations are summarized to calculate the total outage (downtime) duration. Overlapping downtimes are not counted.

### Availability calculation

Availability metrics are calculated by dividing the number of successful executions ("up") by the total number of executions

1. Determine the number of up executions in the timeframe.

   This is the total number of executions in the timeframe, minus the number of failed ("down") executions in the timeframe.
2. Determine availability.

   Divide the number of up executions by the total number of executions, and then multiply by 100 to get a percentage.

**Example**

Suppose we have 5 down executions in a 35-minute timeframe.

* Total executions = `35`.
* Down executions = `5`.
* Up executions = `35-5 = 30`.
* Availability = `(30/35) \* 100 = 0.8571 \* 100` = `85.71 percent`.

#### Exclude maintenance period executions from metrics calculations

You can set up a maintenance window so test executions are not suppressed during maintenance periods. Then, if outages happen during the maintenance period, down executions are included in the metrics calculations.

In the example below, the availability is less than 100% because the down executions are included in the metric calculation by default.

```
timeseries av = avg(dt.synthetic.browser.availability), by: {dt.entity.synthetic_test}



| fields dt.entity.synthetic_test, avgAV=arrayAvg(av)



| filter dt.entity.synthetic_test == "SYNTHETIC_TEST-2891B733D75330FA"
```

![Browser monitor - availability with included maintenance period executions ](https://dt-cdn.net/images/854002b6-0eec-43ce-a39f-f974e1495a83-1280-6e35ac4977.png)

To exclude the maintenance period executions from the metric calculation

1. Add the `dt.maintenance_window_ids` dimension to the query.
2. Filter the executions that are not covered by the maintenance window with `isNull(dt.maintenance_window_ids)`.

In the example below, we observed down executions during the maintenance period. However, they were not included in the calculation metric because we used the `dt.maintenance_window_ids` dimension along with the `isNull(dt.maintenance_window_ids)` filter condition.

```
timeseries av = avg(dt.synthetic.browser.availability), by: {dt.entity.synthetic_test, dt.maintenance_window_ids}



| filter dt.entity.synthetic_test == "SYNTHETIC_TEST-2891B733D75330FA"



| filter isNull(dt.maintenance_window_ids)



| fields avgAV=arrayAvg(av)
```

![Browser monitor - availability with excluded maintenance period executions](https://dt-cdn.net/images/b0e9f9cf-7bb3-4c6a-8487-7c918211ea39-1280-b5a3c8bf0c.png)

#### Interpolation

The approach described above requires all executions to happen at the same rate. However, in a real-world environment this is not always the case as the monitor execution frequency may change or additional on-demand executions may be triggered.

To make the calculation more accurate, the interpolation mechanism is introduced: the total monitoring time is divided into minute-level data points. All data points count as executions, although they don't necessarily coincide with actual executions.

To see interpolated data points, add the `interpolated` dimension to the query.

```
timeseries avg(dt.synthetic.browser.availability), by:{dt.entity.synthetic_test, interpolated}



| filter dt.entity.synthetic_test == "SYNTHETIC_TEST-7E0A1CF206C4A1C5"
```

The result below shows the blue data points that coincide with actual executions, and the white data points which don't.

![Interpolation for browser monitors](https://dt-cdn.net/images/screenshot-2025-07-15-171842-1901-8c5b65b6c4.png)

Let's imagine a monitor is set to execute tests every five minutes. So, every fifth data point (blue) coincides with an actual execution. All data points following the first down execution and preceding the first up execution count as "down". Thus, when calculating the availability metrics, the number of down executions is calculated as follows:

Down executions = the first actual down execution + all following "down" data points.

### Notifications over availability chart

Also, the **Availability** card displays notifications over the availability chart. The notifications show details of a maintenance window, outages, and not executed or finished tests. A notification is displayed as a bar above the timeframe when a maintenance window was applied, an outage occurred, or some tests were not executed or finished. Hover over the bar to see the details:

* **Browser monitor local outage**âthe outage happened in one or more locations from which the monitor executed the tests.
* **Browser monitor global outage**âthe outage happened in all locations from which the monitor executed the tests.

  Local and global outage - view problem details

  To see the details of the problem

  1. Select the bar to pin the **Browser monitor local outage** or **Browser monitor global outage** tooltip.
  2. Hover over the tooltip.
  3. Select  **View problem details**.
  4. Select one of the available options:

  + **Problems** to see the problem details in Latest Dynatrace
  + **Problems Classic** to see the problem details in Dynatrace Classic
* **Maintenance window**âa maintenance window was on in the timeframe.

  How to see the maintenance window, and what happens if the monitor execution is on/off

  To see the maintenance window

  1. Select the bar to pin the **Maintenance window** tooltip.
  2. Hover over the **Maintenance window** tooltip.
  3. Select **View maintenance window settings**.
  4. Select **Settings Classic**.

  + When the **Disable synthetic monitor execution** option is on in the maintenance window, the scheduled automatic tests are suppressed during the maintenance period so there are no tests results for this period. Only [on-demand](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/on-demand-executions "Learn about how to perform on-demand executions.") tests are not suppressed.
  + When the **Disable synthetic monitor execution** option is off in the maintenance window, the tests are executed during the maintenance period, but, due to maintenance, the test results may differ from those observed under the normal conditions.

#### Not executed or finished tests

If some tests were not executed or finished due to improper monitor configurations or some issues at Dynatrace side, you can see a reason behind it:

* **No result**âthe execution started but the results were not delivered. Reach out to the Dynatrace support team.
* **No capability**âyou're trying to execute monitors that aren't supported by a location (for example, NAM ICMP monitors - from a location with inactive ICMP).
* **Discarded, not executed**âthe probable cause is the overloaded private location. Check the capacity metrics. If there are no issues with the metrics, contact the Dynatrace support team.

## Performance

The **Performance** card displays:

* The average duration of each step across all locations (**Step performance** tab).
* The total duration of all steps for each location (**Split by location** tab).

It helps identify slow steps or regional performance issues.

### Display problems in Performance section

* Red bar above the chart indicates an ongoing problem.
* Grey bar above the chart indicates a closed problem.

Only performance problems are marked in this section.

If the monitor violates a performance threshold, whether for the total duration of all steps or for the duration of an individual step, a solid red line appears above the performance graph for the problem duration. Select the solid red bar to display a link to the problem overview page.

View problem details

1. Hover over the problem bar to see an ongoing/closed problem details in the form of a tooltip.
2. Select the problem bar and hover over the tooltip to display more options.
3. Select  **View problem details** to open the problem details in Problems ![Problems app - new](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dynatrace-davis-new-256-340162f8c6.webp "Problems app - new").

## Problems

The **Problems** card shows performance (threshold violation) and availability (local or global outage) problems.

There are three main problem types for browser monitors:

* Global outage (availability).
* Local outage (availability).
* Performance threshold violation (performance problem for sum of all steps or individual steps).

Performance problems may combine threshold violations at the monitor as well as step levels.

The problems section lists all problems in the selected timeframe, both open and closed. On top of that, you can:

* See the details of a problem in the form of a table with a start date and duration.
* Expand each problem to see affected entities and alerting profiles.

Problems, along with their constituent [events](#events) give you a full picture of the number and scope of your monitor's issues.

## Synthetic steps and actions

The **Synthetic steps and actions** card shows details for each browser step the monitor is set to perform. It can be a page loading, click on some button or any other control, etc. For each step, you can see such details as:

* **Action type**âfor example, **Click**.
* **Avg. duration**âaverage response time for a certain timeframe, for example, for the last hour.
* **Screenshot**âthe screenshot taken during the step execution.

Select the expand icon  for a step to see the response time of individual executions in a specific timeframe (for example, the last hour). It allows you to evaluate the overall step performance. The expand icon is unavailable and can't be selected if there is no performance data for the step.

## Errors

The **Errors** card displays errors found in the selected timeframe.

On the card, you can:

* See the details of an error in the form of a table with the step and number of occurrences.
* Select **Analyze errors** .

  You are directed to the **Multidimensional analysis** page in Dynatrace Classic, where you are provided with in-depth error analysis.

## Events

The **Events** card shows all events that compose problems. Events for active as well as resolved problems show up in the list and timeline.

Hover over a time slot in the event timeline to see the type and number of events generated at that interval. Select a time slot to view a tooltip with the events that took place in it.

Select an event type to see the list of events. An event is created per location where, for example, your monitor violates step- or monitor-level performance thresholds. Select an individual event to see details.

## Frontends

The **Frontends** card displays the frontends to which the monitor is assigned.

## Locations

The **Locations** card shows the status of the last monitor execution for each location. The status is displayed with colors:

* Greenâthe location was available during the last monitor execution.
* Redâan outage was detected during the last monitor execution.
* Grayâthere is no data about executions for this location.

## Properties and tags

This informational card shows the number of steps, the number and list of locations, frequency of monitor execution, and any applied tags.

Select  **Edit** to edit or apply additional tags.

## Analyze executions

When using a browser monitor, you can analyze individual monitor executions in detail.

### Analyze executions without new browser monitoring experience

Not applicable to new Dynatrace environments created after January 26, 2026.

If the new browser monitoring experience is not activated, you can analyze executions on the **Multidimensional analysis** page in Synthetic Classic.

1. Select **Analyze executions** at the top of the monitor's details page.

   You are directed to the **Multidimensional analysis** page in Dynatrace Classic.
2. In the **Detailed analysis timeframe** section, select an execution to pin its tooltip.
3. Hover over the tooltip and select **View execution**.

### Analyze executions with new browser monitoring experience

DPS License

If the new browser monitoring experience is activated, you can analyze executions via the Waterfall chart in Latest Dynatrace.

During the monitor execution, one or more pages can be loaded. A set of components (resources) is loaded together with a page.
When you analyze individual monitor executions with the Waterfall chart, you can see detailed information about each resource loaded with the page during the monitor execution. The details include:

* Resource type, for example, script, image, font, data.
* Resource name.
* Resource load duration in ms.
* Resource initiator, for example, fetch, script, link. For details, see [Resource initiator](#resource-initiator).
* Render blocking status.
* Resource load start and end time.

The Waterfall chart can help you detect and isolate specific resources in specific executions that compromise overall performance. Also, it can help you analyze reasons behind the monitor's failures.

![Requests waterfall](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dva18020-dev-apps-dynatracelabs-com-ui-apps-dynatrace-synthetic-monitor-browser-synthetic-test-20b49e870a7513d7-execution-101467063807-1767976953634-waterfall-b66c336f493cc2af-ee600d99f4a5e478-tf-now-2h-3-1-2433-0f91ea90d9.png)

To analyze monitor executions via Waterfall chart

1. Select **Analyze executions** in the upper-right of the monitor details page.
2. Find the needed execution in the **Executions** table. Each row of the table is an execution record. You can use a filter  to narrow down the list of executions. You can filter by location or timeframe.

   If [automatic retry on error](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-configure-browser-monitors#outage-and-performance "Learn how to create and configure a browser monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.") is switched on, the monitor performs a second execution attempt in case the first attempt fails. In the **Executions** table, the second attempt is displayed by default, and a  icon appears in the execution recordâselect  to see the first attempt as well.
3. Select the execution.

   The **Pages** table with the execution details appears. In the **Steps** row, you can see all steps performed during the monitor execution. The timeframe when a step was performed is highlighted with a blue bar displayed in the row. Hover over the bar for the step details, such as the step duration, step type, and the UI element the step is performed to. You can filter  a specific step. In this case, only the bar associated with the filtered step remains blue. All other bars turn gray.

   Under the **Steps** row, the pages loaded during the monitor execution are displayed.

   During the monitor execution, pages can be opened in separate browser windows or tabs. In this case, a record for each window appears in the table with the  icon next to the record. Select the icon to see the pages loaded in that window.

   Under the **Steps** and window (if applicable) row, each consecutive row of the table is a loaded page record. The timeframe when the page was loaded is highlighted with a blue bar displayed in the record.
4. For the needed page, select the page record in the table.

   The **Requests waterfall** card appears, displaying the Waterfall chart for the selected page. The chart displays all resources that were loaded with the page during the execution of:

   * The monitor step when the page was loaded.
   * All subsequent monitor steps when the browser monitor interacted with the page (for example, clicks, keystrokes).

   You can select a resource to see its performance details. The resources loaded with errors have a red mark displayed in the **Type** column.

   ![Request waterfall - resources with errors](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dva18020-dev-apps-dynatracelabs-com-ui-apps-dynatrace-synthetic-monitor-browser-synthetic-test-20b49e870a7513d7-execution-101467063807-1767976953634-waterfall-b66c336f493cc2af-ee600d99f4a5e478-tf-now-2h-3-2-2475-dd4136cf22.png)

#### Resource initiator

The resource initiator is a web platform feature that initiated the resource load. When you know what was the resource initiator, you can, for example, detect the XHR actionsâtheir initiators are usually `xmlhttprequest` and `fetch`.

The resource initiator doesn't represent a type of fetched content. For example, a `.css` file can be fetched with a `<link>` elementâin this case, `link` is specified as the resource initiator.

| Initiator | Request initiated by |
| --- | --- |
| `audio` | `<audio>` element's src attribute |
| `beacon` | `navigator.sendBeacon()` method |
| `body` | `<body>` element's background attribute |
| `css` | CSS `url()` function |
| `early-hint` | 103 Early Hint response |
| `embed` | `<embed>` element's src attribute |
| `fetch` | `fetch()` method |
| `frame` | Loading a `<frame>` element |
| `icon` | A favicon; non-standard and only reported by Safari |
| `iframe` | `<iframe>` element's src attribute |
| `image` | `<image>` element |
| `img` | `<img>` element's src or srcset attribute |
| `input` | `<input>` element of type image |
| `link` | `<link>` element |
| `navigation` | A navigation request |
| `object` | `<object>` element |
| `other` | `(no condition matches)` |
| `ping` | `<a>` element's ping |
| `script` | `<script>` element |
| `track` | `<track>` element's src |
| `video` | `<video>` element's poster or src |
| `xmlhttprequest` | XMLHttpRequest |

# Create a NAM monitor

# Create a NAM monitor

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* 1-min read
* Updated on Dec 05, 2025

With network availability monitors (NAM), you can check the availability of your hosts, devices, and services.

There are three types of NAM monitors: ICMP, TCP, and DNS. To learn more about them, see [NAM types](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/network-availability-monitors/network-availability-monitoring#NAM-types "ICMP, TCP, and DNS synthetic monitors").
You can create NAM monitors in [![Synthetic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-new-256-1ddb35ac79.png "Synthetic") Synthetic](#monitor-configuration) in latest Dynatrace or through [API](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/network-availability-monitors/create-a-nam-monitor#nam-api "Learn how to set up a NAM monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.").

## NAM setup

With NAM monitors, you can include more than one step.

* Each step can contain one or multiple requests.
* Like for HTTP and browser monitors, steps are executed sequentially.
* Unlike for HTTP and browser monitors, NAM monitors can contain multiple requests within a single step. All requests assigned to a particular step are executed in parallel. If one request fails, it doesn't affect the execution of other requests within that step.
* A step is skipped if nothing matches its definition in a monitor configuration. For example, when a tag is specified in the [target filters](#target-filter) list but nothing matches the tag.
* Concept of requests executed in parallel exists for NAM monitors only

For example, if you want to monitor a group of 4 hosts with an ICMP test, you want to apply the same conditions (such as frequency, location executing test, and number of packets) for each host from your group.

NAM offers you the possibility of addressing this in multiple ways:

* You can define 4 separate tests, one per host. The benefit of this approach is that Dynatrace triggers a separate problem for each host and you can assign separate notifications for each one. You can also adjust test parameters for each host separately.
* You can define a single test with 4 requests (within 1 step). The same ICMP checks are executed, but there will be differences in reporting and alerting. The number or percentage of hosts that are down is reported with the Requests Success rate metric. You can configure a customized threshold for failing the whole monitor. For example, if it's OK that 1 out of 4 hosts is down, because of rolling out an update, you can define it on the `>=75%` level. There's always a single problem generated for a monitor, yet still, it contains detailed info about hosts that don't respond. Another benefit of this approach is easier maintenance (adjusting single setting for all 4 hosts).

  Finally, filters offer defining tests against dynamically changing structure, for example if you want to define ICMP tests against a given host group, you don't need to adjust the NAM monitor test after the host group configuration change.

You need to define constraints for each monitor. Constraints are conditions that need to be met to consider the monitorâs execution successful. It is obligatory to define the **Success rate** constraint. See [step-level constraints](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/network-availability-monitors/create-a-nam-monitor#step-level-constraints "Learn how to set up a NAM monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.") to learn more.

## Create a NAM monitor

To create a NAM monitor in latest Dynatrace

1. Go to ![Synthetic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-new-256-1ddb35ac79.png "Synthetic") **Synthetic** and select **Create monitor**.
2. Follow the on-screen steps as outlined in the sections below.

### Select type

The **Create synthetic monitor** page shows the types of synthetic monitor you can create.

Select **Network monitor (NAM)** to get started.

### General

* Required **Name this monitor**âThe name of the monitor as it will be displayed in the web UI (up to 500 characters).
* Required **Select a protocol**âChoose the monitor type: `DNS`, `ICMP`, or `TCP`.
* Optional **Set a description**âDescribe your monitor.
* Optional **Add tags to this monitor**âTo manually create a new tag, select **Add tag**, type the key, optionally provide a value, and select **Add**.

After you specify the general settings, select **Continue**.

### Requests

The **Requests** section has two editing modes. You can switch back and forth between these modes.

* default **Visual**âto view and configure NAM requests through web UI settings.
* **Script**âto view and edit request settings as JSON. The script you provide also serves as payload for API requests.

Settings per request (you can add multiple requests) are:

* Required **Request name**âThe name of the request.
* Required **List of targets** or **Filter expression**

  + You can provide targets for requests as an explicit list, or filter monitored hosts using a filter expression.

    - If you want to provide targets as IP or domain names, use **List of targets** to specify a comma-separated list of targets. Use this to monitor single or multiple hosts, devices, or services.
    - If you want to select some of the monitored hosts or custom devices, use **Filter expression** to specify a filter expression. This allows you to monitor a group of hosts or custom devices that meet the filter criteria. To learn more about available filters, see [target filter](#target-filter).

    You can combine both the **List of targets** and the **Filter expression** in a single monitor step. When used together, the monitor step will include the combined set of targets from both fields.
* Required **Execution attributes**âExecution attributes are essentially key/value pairs that are associated with your request. Define **Request timeout**, **Number of packets**, **Data length**, **Time to live**, **Timeout to reply**, you can also turn on or turn off **Do not fragment data**. Execution attributes are available for ICMP only.
* Required **Constraints**âConstraints are conditions that need to be met to consider monitorâs execution successful. You need to define **Constraint type**, **Operator** and **value**.

If you want to create another request, select **Add next request** and specify the above for the next request.

Use **Duplicate** ![Duplicate](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-app-tile-duplicate-f0d63fb901.svg "Duplicate") to duplicate a request and then edit it from that point instead of starting from scratch each time you add a request.

After you specify all requests, select **Continue**.

### Frequency and locations

In the **Frequency and locations** section, specify the frequency and locations.

* Required **Select frequency**âYou can choose a frequency (every `1 min`, `2 min`, `5 min`, `10 min`, `15 min`, `30 min`, or `1 h`) or select `On demand only` for manual execution.
* Required **n selected locations**âSpecify one or more locations.

After you specify the frequency and locations, select **Continue**.

### Outage and Performance

In **Outage handling**, you can enable and configure the following settings related to problem and alert generation:

* Optional "Generate a problem and send an alert when the monitor is unavailable at all configured locations (global outage)."
* Optional "Generate a problem and send an alert when the monitor is unavailable only when at least two locations are assigned." Note that this option is only possible if you selected two or more locations.
* Optional "Generate a problem and send an alert on performance threshold violations."

After you specify the outage and performance settings, select **Continue**.

### Summary

In the **Summary** section, verify your settings.

After you review the summary, select **Save** to create your monitor or **Back** to go back and adjust your monitor settings.

## Target filter

Target filter gives an option to filter **hosts monitored by Dynatrace** or **custom devices having IP addresses**. With this filter, you can select those two types of targets based on:

* type (`type`)
* tags (`tag`)
* host ID (`hostId`) (deprecated, works for hosts only, use entity ID instead)
* entity ID (`entityId`)
* host groups (`hostGroup`)
* management zones (`managementZone`)
* IP mask (`ipMask`)
* IP range (`ipRange`)
* process group instance (`processGroupInstance`)
* network interfaces of particular custom device (`interfacesOf`)
* extension name (`extensionName`)

IP range and IP mask are filters for hosts or devices known for the Dynatrace server, not an option to scan the network.

### Syntax

* Logical operators: `AND` and `OR` (case insensitive)
* Parentheses
* Expression operators: `==` and `!=`
* Tag names and values
* Negation ("not"): `!=`.
* Wildcard: `*` (selects all hosts monitored by Dynatrace)

### Examples

* `tag == tagname or hostGroup == group1`
* `(tag == tagname1:tagvalue1 or tag == tagname1:tagvalue2) and (hostGroup == group1 or managementZone == zone1)`
* `tag != tagname1 and tag != tagname2:tagvalue`
* `tag == tagname:tagvalue and (managementZone == zone1 or managementZone == zone2)`
* `tag == "[tagwithbrackets and spaces]":"value, with, commas, and, spaces"`
* `ipMask == 127.0.0.1/24`
* `hostId == HOST-000123`
* `type == CUSTOM_DEVICE and ipMask == 172.17.0.2/24`
* `entityId == HOST-045BFCDA3F507D30 or entityId == CUSTOM_DEVICE-13081D4B74B3E2C8`
* `type == HOST and processGroupInstance == PROCESS_GROUP_INSTANCE-07611353BB98908C`
* `type == CUSTOM_DEVICE and interfacesOf == CUSTOM_DEVICE-E1A88946BF04D5E7`
* `type == CUSTOM_DEVICE and extensionName == "Docker devices"`

## Performance thresholds

The performance threshold metric is compared to metric calculated for each request within monitor/step. For example, if TCP port check monitor, tests on the same host port `80` and `443` separately, Dynatrace compares threshold TCP connection establishment time twice, once for port `80` and once for port `443`.

There are three performance metrics for three types of NAM monitors:

* RTT for ICMP
* TCP connection establishment time for TCP
* DNS resolution time for DNS

Violating defined performance triggers a Problem (Slowdown).

Similarly to availability problems:

* Problems are opened per monitor
* Contains information about all requests responsible for problem

You can configure the way Dynatrace aggregates results for each packet for ICMP requests with single execution. Dynatrace supports AVG, MAX and MIN with `AVG` as the default method.

### Define thresholds

You can define performance thresholds when configuring the request for your synthetic monitor. The defined performance threshold is the same for all requests within a single step. In cases, where there's a need to build a multi-step NAM monitor, it's possible to define various thresholds for each step.

To define thresholds

1. Follow the steps described in [Create a NAM monitor](#monitor-configuration) section.
2. In the **Requests** step, scroll down the page and see **Performance thresholds alerting** section.
3. Select **Generate a problem and send an alert on performance threshold violations.** check box.
4. Turn on **Advanced performance thresholds settings** toggle.

   In this section you can set the **Number of request executions in analyzed sliding window** and the **Number of violating request executions in analyzed sliding window**. For de-alerting samples we require `n` most recent non-violating request executions.

### Violation reporting

Red color annotation over performance charts indicates the period of time during which the performance threshold is raised. Additionally, a threshold is drawn on the performance chart, and you can examine which requests are above the threshold.

You may narrow down the time range only to that for which the problem was active using zoom functionality.

# Create and configure an HTTP monitor

# Create and configure an HTTP monitor

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* 10-min read
* Updated on Nov 06, 2025

You can create synthetic HTTP monitors to check the availability of your resourcesâwebsites or API endpoints. HTTP monitors can be run from our [global public](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/public-synthetic-locations "Learn about all currently available public Synthetic Monitoring locations.") or [private](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring.") Synthetic locations.

## Create a new HTTP monitor

Go to ![Synthetic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-new-256-1ddb35ac79.png "Synthetic") **Synthetic** >  **Monitor** > **HTTP**.

### General

1. **Name this monitor**âenter a name (up to 500 characters) for the synthetic monitor. This name should generally describe all the requests in this HTTP monitor.
2. Select **Add tag** to manually apply tags to the monitor. After the monitor has been created, you can manage tags from the [HTTP monitor details page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/synthetic-details-for-http-monitors#properties-tags "Learn about the Synthetic details page for HTTP monitors.").
3. Select **Assign frontends** to assign a monitor to a frontend application. You can assign the monitor to multiple applications, and an application can have several assigned monitors. It allows you to track application availability and performance. Detected problems are then automatically associated with your application. If the monitor is unavailable, the associated application is also considered to be unavailable.

   Note that you cannot block Synthetic Monitoring traffic for RUM applications by [excluding bots, spiders, or the IP addresses of Synthetic locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/exclude-browsers-robots-and-spiders-from-monitoring "Disable Real User Monitoring for certain IP addresses, browsers, bots, and spiders.").

### Requests

You can configure one or more requests in **Visual** or **Script** mode. In **Visual** mode the settings are shown in couple of groups:

* Basic configuration (request name and URL)
* Security (authentication and client certificateâfor both of them an existing credential saved in the credential vault can be selected or users can create a new one)

  + In **Security** section, turn on the **Set authentication/authorization** toggle to select the **Basic**, **NTLM** or **Kerberos** security method. For more details, see [synthetic authentication](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/synthetic-authentication#basic-ntlm "Learn how to configure authentication methods for monitoring web applications and API endpoints in Synthetic Monitoring.").
* SSL certificate (accept any SSL certificate and generate a problem if SSL certificate expires within the next `n` days)
* Execution attributes (HTTP method, user agent, additional HTTP headers and advanced attributes: follow redirects, ignore sensitive information, pre-/-post-execution script)
* Advanced attributes

  + **Ignore sensitive information** checkboxâexpand the **Advanced attributes** section and select this option to hide potentially sensitive information (contained in, say, the request headers, request body, sometimes URL).

    You need to do this for each request you wish to limit the display of. Request and response bodies, values of request and response headers, and peer certificate details are then replaced by placeholder text.

  Users with access to any credentials contained in the monitor may disable it.
* Constraints (response status code, response body pattern, response body regex)
* Performance thresholds alerting (threshold for this request)
* Basic configuration (request name)

  + **Name**âobligatory field which stands for a monitor step
* Target selection (URL)

  + **HTTP request URL**

    - To enhance synthetic monitor security, Dynatrace blocks monitors from sending requests to a local host (for example, `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`).
    - You can add a credential ID from the [vault](/docs/manage/credential-vault "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.") to the request URL. Use the format `{<credential ID>|token}`, `{<credential ID>|username}`, or `{<credential ID>|password}`, for example `https://example.com/api/random/{CREDENTIALS_VAULT-0000000000000000|token}` as appropriate for the type of credential you're inserting. You can only copy and paste credentials to which you have access.

      Who can edit a monitor that has associated credentials?

      * If a monitor is associated with a public credential, anyone on your team can switch on/off, delete, or edit the monitor.

      * If an HTTP monitor is associated with restricted credential (owner only or shared with a few users), any user can make changes to certain fields, even if they don't have access to the credential used. You can edit monitor name, locations, validation, thresholds, and, of course, change a certificate or a UID/password pair. You can edit and change the credentials in a URL, header value, or request body. You can create a credential within monitor settings in edit mode. You'll need to change all credentials in the monitor to ones that you have access to. Note that replacing another user's credential with one you have access to is irreversible.

        Controls that you cannot edit such as the request URL, HTTP method, pre-execution script, post-execution script, HTTP headers, request body, the follow redirects option, and adding/deleting HTTP requests are grayed out or display an error message when you attempt to save changes, whether in script or UI mode.

      * You can make active/inactive or delete a synthetic monitor that's secured by another user's owner-only credentials.

        Read more about credential permissions in [Credential vault for synthetic monitors](/docs/manage/credential-vault "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.").
* Security (authentication and client certificateâfor both of them an existing credential saved in the credential vault can be selected or users can create a new one)

  + Turn on the **Set authentication/authorization** toggle to select the **Basic**, **NTLM** or **Kerberos** security method. For more details, see [synthetic authentication](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/synthetic-authentication#basic-ntlm "Learn how to configure authentication methods for monitoring web applications and API endpoints in Synthetic Monitoring.").

    Provide a username/password pair to automate the login process for password-protected sites via **Basic**, **NTLM**, or **Kerberos** authentication. Dynatrace automatically generates the required `Authorization` header with the information you've provided. (Read more about [Supported authentication methods in Synthetic Monitoring](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/synthetic-authentication "Learn how to configure authentication methods for monitoring web applications and API endpoints in Synthetic Monitoring.").)

    Dynatrace stores and manages all Synthetic Monitoring credentials in a credential vault. Credentials are access controlled and can be designated as owner only or public.

    You can choose an existing credential (**Select credentials**). You can only see the credentials that you have access to in this list, that is, public credentials or owner-only credentials created by you.

    You can create **New credential** by entering a **Username** and **Password**. Provide a **Credential name** and **Save to vault**.

    The `<domain>\<username>` format is not supported for the username in HTTP monitors; simply provide the `<username>`.

    The credentials you create this way are automatically set to owner-only permissions and can only be used by you. Note that you can create credentials this way in a new or existing HTTP monitor even if you don't have permissions to access credential management in the [credential vault](/docs/manage/credential-vault "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.").
  + Turn on the **Add client certificate** toggle to switch on client-side certificate authentication. To learn more, see [Supported authentication methods in Synthetic Monitoring](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/synthetic-authentication "Learn how to configure authentication methods for monitoring web applications and API endpoints in Synthetic Monitoring.").

    You can choose an existing credential (**Select credentials**). You can only see the credentials that you have access to in this list, that is, public credentials or owner-only credentials created by you.

    You can create a new credential:

    1. Select **+ New credential**.
    2. Upload a **Certificate file** (in PFX, P12, or PEM format).
    3. Enter a **Password**.
    4. Provide a **Credential name**.
    5. Select **Save to vault**.

    The credentials you create this way are automatically set to owner-only permissions and can only be used by you. Note that you can create credentials this way in a new or existing HTTP monitor even if you don't have permissions to access credential management in the [credential vault](/docs/manage/credential-vault "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.").

    To assure full mutual authentication, switch off **Accept any SSL certificate** when using certificate authentication.
* SSL certificate (accept any SSL certificate and generate a problem if SSL certificate expires within the next `n` days)

  + **Accept any SSL certificate**âby default, HTTP monitors fail when SSL certificates are invalid. Check the box to make the monitor accept any SSL certificates regardless of whether they're valid.

    Reasons for SSL certificate invalidity

    Depending on your settings, your HTTP monitor can fail or succeed when an SSL certificate is invalid for any of the following reasons:

    - Certificate is self signed
    - Certificate has expired
    - Certificate is inactive
    - Certificate lifetime is greater than 398 days
    - Missing hostname
    - Invalid/incomplete certificate chain
    - Untrusted certificate authority
    - Insecure signature algorithm

  + **Generate a problem if the SSL certificate expires within the next n days**âturn on this option to generate an **SSL certificate expiration problem** when an SSL certificate is missing, expired, or will expire within the specified number of days (must be 100 or less). Note that, this problem is generated without failing the monitor or affecting monitor availability.

    SSL certificate expiration problems have the custom severity level and display the number of days remaining until certificate expiry. This value is updated with each execution of the affected monitor.

    The following examples show how to apply the **SSL certificate expiration date verification** and **Accept any SSL certificate** settings.

    - If you want to configure a monitor that accepts a self-signed certificate while triggering an alert for certificate expiry, you would:

      * Turn on **Accept any SSL certificate**.
      * Turn on **SSL certificate expiration date verification** and set a threshold for problem generation.
    - If you choose not to accept any SSL certificate, and the SSL certificate has expired, the HTTP monitor will fail and trigger an outage problem with an `SSL certificate expired` message in problem details and in the **Events** and **Failed requests** cards in [HTTP monitor details](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/synthetic-details-for-http-monitors "Learn about the Synthetic details page for HTTP monitors.").
    - If you turn on both these options, and the SSL certificate has expired, the HTTP monitor will trigger an SSL certificate expiration problem. The **Events** card will display a custom alert for SSL certificate expiration.
    - If you turn on both these options and specify a threshold of `n` days for SSL certificate expiry, and the SSL certificate expires within `n` days, the HTTP monitor will trigger an SSL certificate expiration problem. The **Events** card will display a custom alert for SSL certificate expiration.

      HTTP monitor validation

      The following types of rules are evaluated for HTTP monitor validation in the `validation.rules` section in [script mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/script-mode-for-http-monitor-configuration-classic "Create or edit your HTTP monitors in JSON format.").

      * Response status code validation
      * Text validation, where the first 50 KB of the response body is checked for a string of text or a regular expression
      * SSL certificate expiry validation (ActiveGate version 1.235+)

      In a monitor containing multiple validations, all rules are evaluated. However, a single execution status is returned based on priority: HTTP status code validation is the most important, followed by text and regular expression validation, and finally by SSL certificate expiry validation.
* Execution attributes (HTTP method, user agent, additional HTTP headers and advanced attributes: follow redirects, ignore sensitive information, pre-/-post-execution script)

  + **HTTP request method**

    For each request you create or edit, start with the **HTTP method**, because the available request settings depend on this selection. Supported HTTP methods are:

    - GET
    - POST
    - PUT
    - DELETE
    - HEAD
    - PATCH
    - OPTIONS
  + Optional [**User agent**ï»¿](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent)

    The default user agent is in the format `DynatraceSynthetic/{version}`, where `{version}` is the current version of the Synthetic engine executing the monitor. Even if you define a custom user agent, Dynatrace automatically appends `DynatraceSynthetic/{version}` to the user agent to make sure that synthetic monitoring traffic can be identified. **Do not** use `DynatraceSynthetic/` in your custom user agent; this is reserved for Dynatrace use.

  + **Set additional HTTP headers**

    The monitor is created with a bare minimum set of headers required by the protocol. Choose this option to create custom/additional headers:

    1. Select **+ HTTP header**.
    2. Enter **Header name** and **Header value**.
    3. Add another header by clicking **+ HTTP header** as needed.

    Use HTTP headers to implement bearer or token authenticationâread more in [Supported authentication methods in Synthetic Monitoring](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/synthetic-authentication#bearer-token "Learn how to configure authentication methods for monitoring web applications and API endpoints in Synthetic Monitoring.").

    You can add token credentials to the header value. Use the format `{<credential ID>|token}`, `{<credential ID>|username}`, or `{<credential ID>|password}`, for example `{CREDENTIALS_VAULT-0000000000000000|token}` as appropriate for the type of credential you're inserting. You can only copy and paste credentials to which you have access.

    Default HTTP headers

    These are the default headers Dynatrace creates per request.

    Name

    Value

    `Accept`

    `*/*`

    `Connection`

    `close`

    `Host`

    `<hostname>`

    `User-Agent`

    `DynatraceSynthetic/{version}`[1](#fn-1-1-def)

    1

    `{version}` is the current version of the Synthetic engine executing the monitor. Even if you [define a custom user agent](#basic-settings), Dynatrace always automatically adds `DynatraceSynthetic/{version}` to the user agent to make sure that synthetic monitoring traffic can be identified.

    Dynatrace also creates the `x-Dynatrace-Tenant`, and `x-Dynatrace-Test` headers for internal administrative purposes.
  + **Set request body**

    You can send a payload with your **POST**, **PUT**, **DELETE**, and **PATCH** requests. You can add token credentials to the request body. Use the format `{<credential ID>|token}`, `{<credential ID>|username}`, or `{<credential ID>|password}`, for example `{CREDENTIALS_VAULT-0000000000000000|token}` as appropriate for the type of credential you're inserting. You can only use credentials to which you have access, that is, public credentials or owner-only credentials created by you. If this field contains an [owner-only token](/docs/manage/credential-vault#owner-shared-public "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault."), it cannot be edited by other users.
* Advanced attributes

  + **Follow redirects**âby default, an HTTP monitor follows up to 10 redirects from an original request until it reaches the final destination. Turn this option off to monitor only the first response of the redirect chain, for example, to check redirect response status codes.
  + **Set pre-execution script**â[pre- and post-execution scripts](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/pre-and-post-scripting-for-http-monitors-classic "Learn how to apply pre and post scripts to your requests") allows you to add custom logic between HTTP monitor requests to do things like parsing the response, modifying the request URL, or skipping requests under certain conditions.

    If you choose this, an edit box is displayed for you to enter a script that is executed just before the request is triggered. Pre-execution scripts are based on custom JavaScript code and can be used to build your HTTP request or to add logic that you cannot or do not want to implement in the UI.

    For more information and a method reference, see [Pre- and post-execution scripts for HTTP monitors](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/pre-and-post-scripting-for-http-monitors-classic#methods "Learn how to apply pre and post scripts to your requests"). Note that some methods are only available for use in [pre-execution scripts](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/pre-and-post-scripting-for-http-monitors-classic#pre-execution "Learn how to apply pre and post scripts to your requests") or [post-execution scripts](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/pre-and-post-scripting-for-http-monitors-classic#post-execution "Learn how to apply pre and post scripts to your requests").
  + **Set post-execution script**âif you choose this, an edit box is displayed for you to enter a script that is executed after the request is completed. Post-execution scripts are based on custom JavaScript code and can be used process responses to the request.

    The [`api.fail()` method](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/pre-and-post-scripting-for-http-monitors-classic#end "Learn how to apply pre and post scripts to your requests") can be used to define a custom **Failure message** that appears in the Events card on the [HTTP monitor details page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/synthetic-details-for-http-monitors "Learn about the Synthetic details page for HTTP monitors.").

    For more information and a method reference, see [Pre- and post-execution scripts for HTTP monitors](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/pre-and-post-scripting-for-http-monitors-classic "Learn how to apply pre and post scripts to your requests"). Note that some methods are only available for use in [pre-execution scripts](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/pre-and-post-scripting-for-http-monitors-classic#pre-execution "Learn how to apply pre and post scripts to your requests") or [post-execution scripts](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/pre-and-post-scripting-for-http-monitors-classic#post-execution "Learn how to apply pre and post scripts to your requests").
  + **Ignore sensitive information**âselect this option to hide potentially sensitive information (contained in, say, the request headers, request body, sometimes URL).
* Constraints (response status code, response body pattern, response body regex)

  Response validation allows you to pass/fail your monitor based on expected content in the first 50 KB of the response body.

  + **Pass if** or **Fail if** determines the basic test.
  + **Text contains** specifies the text to look for in the response. This string is case sensitive. If your string contains non-ASCII characters, escape them in [script mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/script-mode-for-http-monitor-configuration-classic "Create or edit your HTTP monitors in JSON format.").
  + **Interpret content match as regular expression** treats the specified text as a [regular expression](/docs/manage/tags-and-metadata/reference/regular-expressions-in-dynatrace "Learn how to use regular expressions in the context of Dynatrace.").

  You can add two or more constraints of the same type, for example, if your case requires finding two or more patterns within the response body.

  You can set up multiple such text-validation rules in [script mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/script-mode-for-http-monitor-configuration-classic "Create or edit your HTTP monitors in JSON format.").

  HTTP monitor validation

  The following types of rules are evaluated for HTTP monitor validation in the `validation.rules` section in [script mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/script-mode-for-http-monitor-configuration-classic "Create or edit your HTTP monitors in JSON format.").

  + Response status code validation
  + Text validation, where the first 50 KB of the response body is checked for a string of text or a regular expression
  + SSL certificate expiry validation (ActiveGate version 1.235+)

  In a monitor containing multiple validations, all rules are evaluated. However, a single execution status is returned based on priority: HTTP status code validation is the most important, followed by text and regular expression validation, and finally by SSL certificate expiry validation.
* Performance thresholds alerting (threshold for this request)

  You can use the **Generate a problem and send an alert on performance threshold violations** toggle to set up the timeout threshold for this particular request of the HTTP monitor. The problems triggering and alerting in case of violating performance threshold must be additionlly set when configuring [Outage and performance](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-and-configure-an-http-monitor#outage-and-performance "Learn how to set up and edit an HTTP monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.").

In **Visual** mode, you can also:

* Select  icon and drag it up or down to change the order of requests.
* Select  icon and delete the request.
* Select  icon and duplicate the request.

### Frequency and locations

Two factors make up your monitoring scheduleâhow frequently your browser monitor runs and the number of locations it's executed from.

Dynatrace offers a global network of [public Synthetic Monitoring locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/public-synthetic-locations "Learn about all currently available public Synthetic Monitoring locations.") out-of-the-box. You can also [create private Synthetic locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring.") within your own network infrastructure. Both public and private locations appear on this settings page.

The frequency and number of locations determine the number of monitor executions per hour. For example, running a monitor from 3 locations every 15 minutes results in 12 executions per hour (4 times per hour from each of the 3 locations). Monitor executions are evenly spaced within the selected interval. That is, for a monitor running from 3 locations every 15 minutes, executions are triggered at 5-minute intervals.

You can choose a frequency of every **5**, **10**, **15**, or **30** minutes; or **1**, **2**, or **4** hours. You can also set up your monitor to be executed [**On demand only**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/on-demand-executions "Execute synthetic monitors on demand from public or private locations"). You can select multiple global locations from where your browser monitor is to be executed.

Note that all public Synthetic locations are set to Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC. If your monitor script requires the local time or time zone, you can use the [`api.getContext()` method](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/browser-clickpath-events#retrieve-data "Learn about the event types created when recording a browser clickpath.") and the system clock to implement conditional logic.

### Outage and performance

You can set global and local **Outage handling** and **Performance thresholds** for the sum of all requests.

* **Generate a problem and send an alert when this monitor is unavailable at all configured locations (global outage).**

  This setting is enabled by default for newly created monitors. It alerts you of global availability outages, that is, when all locations experience a failure simultaneously.

  By default, a global outage problem is generated when all locations fail one time. However, you can specify the number of consecutive failures (from 1 to 5) for a global outage problem, that is, how many times all locations need to fail consecutively in order to generate a global outage problem.
* **Generate a problem and send an alert when this monitor is unavailable for one or more consecutive runs at any location. Local outage problem generation is available only when at least two locations are assigned.**

  This allows you to raise a problem when there are consecutive failures at one or more locations. At the environment level, you can choose the number of failures. At the monitor level, you can also determine the number of monitor locations that need to fail in order to generate a local outage problem.

For **Performance thresholds**, you can turn on:

* **Generate a problem and send an alert on performance threshold violations.**

  This setting provides an option to set the **Threshold for the sum of all requests (in seconds)**. If the threshold exceeds the time you provided, you'll be notified.

### Summary

See the summary of all the steps and the estimated monthly number of requests.

See [HTTP monitors reporting results](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/synthetic-details-for-http-monitors "Learn about the Synthetic details page for HTTP monitors.") for monitoring analytics of each monitor.

# Create and configure a browser monitor

# Create and configure a browser monitor

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Updated on Jan 30, 2026

You can create synthetic browser monitors to check the availability of your websites. Browser monitors can be run from our [global public](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/public-synthetic-locations "Learn about all currently available public Synthetic Monitoring locations.") or [private](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations "Learn how to manage private locations in the Synthetic app.") synthetic locations.

Go to ![Synthetic Classic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-512-83ec796e54.png "Synthetic Classic") **Synthetic** >  **New monitor** > **Browser**. The configuration settings are split into the following sections:

* [General](#general)
* [Steps](#steps)
* [Frequency and locations](#frequency-and-locations)
* [Outage and performance](#outage-and-performance)
* [Advanced setup](#advanced-setup)
* [Summary](#summary)

Go through all the sections one by one and make all needed configurations within each section.

## General

To start with, configure the general settings.

1. **Name this monitor**âenter a name (up to 500 characters) for the synthetic monitor. This name should generally describe all the requests in this browser monitor.

2. Select **Add tag** to manually apply tags to the monitor.
3. Select **Assign frontends** to assign a monitor to a frontend application. You can assign the monitor to multiple frontend applications, and a frontend application can have several assigned monitors. It allows you to track the frontend application availability and performance. Detected problems are then automatically associated with your frontend application. If the monitor's executions fail due to problems with the frontend application, the reported availability rate of the frontend application is decreased within a specific timeframe.

   A browser monitor can be assigned to a fronted application automatically if a URL checked by the monitor matches a pattern defined in [![Experience Vitals](https://dt-cdn.net/images/experience-vitals-256-9999590b55.png "Experience Vitals") **Experience Vitals**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/new-rum-experience/experience-vitals "The Experience Vitals app provides an entry point for monitoring web and mobile frontends.").

Advanced settings

4. Optional Specify **Device profile**. You can choose from:

   * **Existing devices** with preset characteristics. You can modify only the orientationâmake it either landscape or portrait.
   * **Custom device**âadd a new device with custom characteristics like orientation (landscape or portrait), screen height, and screen width, and provide the new device's **Custom name**.
5. Optional Specify **Bandwidth profile**. You can choose from:

   * **Existing profile** with ready-to-use presets.
   * **Custom profile**âadd a new bandwidth profile with custom characteristics like download speed, upload speed, and latency, and provide the new profile's **Custom name**.
6. Optional Specify **User agent** to adjust a user agent HTTP header that is sent from the browser during the monitor's executions. When you choose **Device profile** from **Existing devices**, Dynatrace pre-populates **User agent**.

   The default Dynatrace user agent during recording and local playback is in the format `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/{version} Safari/537.36 RuxitSynthetic/1.0 v0 t0 cfeatureHash=7efgijmoqtvx caes=1 ccux=1 sia=1 smf=1`, where:

   * `{version}` is the current Chrome version used for recording.
   * `v0` and `t0` identify Synthetic Monitoring traffic.
   * `sia=1` indicates faster RUM JavaScript injection (value can be `1` or `0`).
   * `smf=1` indicates monitoring of pages in frames (if **Capture performance metrics for pages loaded in frames** is switched on in [**Advanced setup**](#other); value is `0` if not switched on).
   * `cfeatureHash=<value>` appears when custom RUM JavaScript settings are switched on in [**Advanced setup**](#custom-rum-js-settings).
   * The default user agent string for browser monitor execution from public or private Synthetic locations is `Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/{version} Safari/537.36 RuxitSynthetic/1.0 v{id} t{id} ath{id} alt{id} cfeatureHash=7efgijmoqtvx caes=1 ccux=1 sia=1 smf=1`, where:

     + `{id}` represents long IDs used by Dynatrace to identify a monitor execution.
     + Other parameters are as described above.

     Note that even if a custom user agent is defined, Dynatrace always automatically adds `RuxitSynthetic/1.0 v{id} t{id} ath{id} alt{id}`, `sia`, `smf`, and, if applicable, `cfeaturehash` and any key-value pairs beginning with `c` to the user agent to make sure that Synthetic Monitoring traffic can be identified.

## Steps

Define the steps. You have two options when you create a browser monitor:

* Set up a monitor to test a single web page against availability and performance. To do so, perform steps 1â7 and step 9 in the guide below (skip step 8).
* Set up a monitor to perform a test scenario that includes a user journeyâfor example, when they open the home page in a browser, apply search criteria, perform search, and select an option from the search results. To do so, complete all the steps listed below (1â9).

1. **Name**âprovide a step name.
2. **URL**âprovide a URL of a web page you want to test against availability and performance.
3. Optional Provide **Context setup**. You can specify:

   * Cookies that will be sent with requests performed by the monitor.
   * Request headers that will be set for all requests performed by the monitor.
   * Requests with specific patterns that will be blocked during the monitor executions.

   Although you can specify cookies, headers, and requests with specific patterns later in [Advanced setup](#advanced-setup), in some cases it may be reasonable to do it here to ensure smooth [recording of a clickpath](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-configure-browser-monitors/clickpath-synthetic-app-browser-monitor "Learn how to record a browser clickpath for a browser monitor").
4. Optional Turn on **Use HTTP authentication** if the website you want to test is protected by HTTP authentication (not handled by web form authentication).

   We support a basic **HTTP authentication** and **Kerberos** authentication. If you choose **Kerberos** as an authentication, also provide a realm name and authentication server allow list.

   You can choose how you want to store credentials.

   * **Credential Vault**âa recommended option since it provides more security. Select previously existing credentials or add new ones.

     You can add new credentials in both ![Synthetic Classic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-512-83ec796e54.png "Synthetic Classic") **Synthetic** ( **Add credential**) and previous Dynatrace (**Credential vault (classic)**).
   * **Monitor script**âprovide a username and password.
5. Optional Choose the **Condition to consider this step as done** to [define a waiting time between steps](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-configure-browser-monitors/steps-waiting-time-validation-thresholds#steps-waiting-time "Learn how to customize a waiting time between steps, validate content, and set up performance thresholds.").
6. Optional In the **Validate content** section, set up [content validation rules](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-configure-browser-monitors/steps-waiting-time-validation-thresholds#validate-content "Learn how to customize a waiting time between steps, validate content, and set up performance thresholds.").
7. Optional Set up a [performance threshold](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-configure-browser-monitors/steps-waiting-time-validation-thresholds#performance-thresholds "Learn how to customize a waiting time between steps, validate content, and set up performance thresholds.") for loading of the page specified in the **URL**.
8. Record a clickpath or add steps manually. Use this functionality if you want the monitor to perform a test scenario that includes a user journeyâfor example, when they open the home page in browser, apply search criteria, perform search, and select an option from the search results. For details, see [Record a browser clickpath](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-configure-browser-monitors/clickpath-synthetic-app-browser-monitor "Learn how to record a browser clickpath for a browser monitor").

   ![Browser monitor steps](https://dt-cdn.net/images/screenshot-2025-08-29-151144-1417-d6dc411680.png)
9. Select **Continue** to proceed with the monitor configuration.

## Frequency and locations

Two factors make up your monitoring scheduleâhow frequently your browser monitor runs and the number of locations it's executed from.

Dynatrace offers a global network of [public Synthetic Monitoring locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/public-synthetic-locations "Learn about all currently available public Synthetic Monitoring locations.") out of the box. You can also [create private Synthetic locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations "Learn how to manage private locations in the Synthetic app.") within your own network infrastructure. Both public and private locations appear on this settings page.

The frequency and number of locations determine the number of monitor executions per hour. For example, running a monitor from 3 locations every 15 minutes results in 12 executions per hour (4 times per hour from each of the 3 locations). Monitor executions are evenly spaced within the selected interval. That is, for a monitor running from 3 locations every 15 minutes, executions are triggered at 5-minute intervals.

You can choose a frequency of every **5**, **10**, **15**, or **30** minutes; or **1**, **2**, or **4** hours. You can also set up your monitor to be executed [**On demand only**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/on-demand-executions "Learn about how to perform on-demand executions."). You can select multiple global locations from where your browser monitor is to be executed.

Note that all public Synthetic locations are set to Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC. If your monitor script requires the local time or time zone, you can use the [`api.getContext()` method](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-configure-browser-monitors/browser-clickpath-steps#retrieve-data "Learn about the step types created when recording a browser clickpath") and the system clock to implement conditional logic.

## Outage and performance

You can set global and local **Outage handling** and **Performance thresholds** for the sum of all requests.

* **Generate a problem and send an alert when this monitor is unavailable at all configured locations (global outage).**

  This setting is turned on by default for newly created monitors. It alerts you of global availability outages, that is, when all locations experience a failure simultaneously.

  By default, a global outage problem is generated when all locations fail one time. However, you can specify the number of consecutive failures (from 1 to 5) for a global outage problem, that is, how many times all locations need to fail consecutively in order to generate a global outage problem.
* **Generate a problem and send an alert when this monitor is unavailable for one or more consecutive runs at any location. Local outage problem generation is available only when at least two locations are assigned.**

  This allows you to raise a problem when there are consecutive failures at one or more locations. At the environment level, you can choose the number of failures. At the monitor level, you can also determine the number of monitor locations that need to fail in order to generate a local outage problem.

**Automatic retry on error** is turned on by default (you can turn it off if needed), which means that failing monitor executions are retried immediately one time to avoid false positives, and only the second result is taken into account. When turned off, we proceed with the first result right away.

For **Performance thresholds**, you can turn on:

* **Generate a problem and send an alert on performance threshold violations.**

  This setting provides an option to set the **Threshold for the sum of all requests (in seconds)**. If the threshold exceeds the time you provided, you'll be notified.

  Also, you can set a performance threshold for [separate steps](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-configure-browser-monitors/steps-waiting-time-validation-thresholds#performance-thresholds "Learn how to customize a waiting time between steps, validate content, and set up performance thresholds.").

You can set up certificate authentication for browser monitors running on any [public location](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/public-synthetic-locations "Learn about all currently available public Synthetic Monitoring locations.") and [private locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations "Learn how to manage private locations in the Synthetic app.") with Linux-based ActiveGates (containerized as well as non-containerized).

Before first recording a clickpath on a website that requires certificate authentication, ensure that you have installed the required certificate in Chrome. Then, when you navigate to the website in the recording window, the native browser dialog simply selects the correct certificate.

After you record the clickpath, you need to specify the certificate to use for browser monitor execution.

1. Select **Add certificate**.
2. Enter the **Domain** that the certificate is valid for.
3. Select a credential from the list of certificate credentials displayed. Alternatively, select **Create new credential** to upload and use a new client certificate. Any certificate credential you create is automatically designated as [owner only](/docs/manage/credential-vault#work-with-credentials "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.") and stored in the [credential vault](/docs/manage/credential-vault "Store and manage credentials in the credential vault.").

You can specify and upload certificate files in PFX, P12, or PEM format.

### Set cookies

Cookies allow you to store browser state information on the client side so that each monitor execution is based on the same state and you can accurately monitor a performance baseline.

The cookies set in **Advanced setup** are valid for the entire monitor execution. If you want to set cookies only for a specific portion of your clickpath, use the [Cookie step](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-configure-browser-monitors/browser-clickpath-steps#cookie "Learn about the step types created when recording a browser clickpath").

Select **Add cookie**, provide a **Name** and cookie **Value**. Every cookie must be unique within the list.

The following symbols are not allowed in the cookie value: `;,\"`. Provide the **Domain** of the cookie, and optionally, the **Path** to the cookie.

### Add additional HTTP headers

The monitor is created with a bare minimum set of headers required by the protocol.

1. Select **Add header**.
2. Enter a **Header** name and **Value**.

You can specify multiple HTTP headers. They will be set for all requests the monitor makes.

If you want to set headers only for specific requests, select **Only apply headers to requests matching a pattern** and then define a **Pattern**. After that, the header is only set for requests that match the pattern youâve defined.

### Block specific requests

You can block one or more requests by specifying complete URLs or match patterns. The URL or regex string cannot exceed 90 characters and is case insensitive.

Blocking requests allows you to analyze how these requests affect your application's performance and optimize it accordingly.

Select **Add pattern**, and then provide a complete URL.

You can also define patterns, for example, `http:*://*/*.png` or `https*://*/*.png` to block all requests to PNG images.

Matching requests are blocked throughout monitor execution and arenât dependent on events.

If you're unable to block specific requests, refer to the Dynatrace Community article [Unable to block specific requests (owing to limitations on the length of regular expressions)ï»¿](https://dt-url.net/w0i2xhk).

### Ignore specific status codes

This allows you to exclude HTTP status codes 400â599 from causing availability outages/errors if encountered in the main document request. Typically, this is the base page in a load action. If this setting is turned on, and the base page of a load action encounters HTTP errors 400â599, an availability outage is not triggered.

You can specify an exact status code, range, or status class mask. Use commas to separate multiple values; use the minus sign (`-`) with no spaces for a range, for example, `404, 405-410, 5xx`. You can apply the rule only to document requests that match a specific regular expression (**Only apply to document request matching this regex**).

* This setting does not apply to XHR requests or document requests in iframes; browser monitors do not fail when an XHR request or a document request in an iframe fails.
* This setting applies to future executions, that is, executions that take place after the setting is turned on.

### Custom RUM JavaScript settings

**Capture XmlHttpRequest (XHR)** and **Capture fetch() requests** are turned on by default. You can turn them off.

### Other

**Bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) of monitored page**âif you have a Content Security Policy in place, it's likely to prevent the browser from sending monitoring data to the Dynatrace Cluster. As a first and preferred method to have Chrome bypass the CSP of any monitored pages in your single-URL browser monitor or browser clickpath, turn on this option. If you're unable to use this option for some reason, refer to the advanced solutions for bypassing CSP in the Dynatrace Community article [Browser monitors: Issues with Content Security Policyï»¿](https://dt-url.net/ycs2x56).

**Capture performance metrics for pages loaded in frames**âturn this on to begin capturing performance data for pages in iframes or framesets.

## Summary

See the summary of all the steps and the estimated monthly number of actions. If everything's OK, and no more adjustments are needed, **Save** the newly configured monitor.

On-demand monitor execution

[On-demand monitor execution](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/on-demand-executions "Learn about how to perform on-demand executions.") via web UI is available as part of DPS license only. The retention period for data from monitor execution is 35 days.  
For Non-DPS license users, monitor execution is possible via [API](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/synthetic-v2/synthetic-monitor-execution "View the results of Synthetic monitor executions via the Synthetic v2 API."). You can access the results for the last 6 hours.

To display a reporting page for your monitor, select **View details** in upper-right corner of the preview panel.

The default reporting pages consists of:

* Tiles displaying information at a glance about global outages, active issues, number of affected locations, availability, total downtime, and duration.
* **Availability**âa chart of availability over time. Availability for NAM monitors is calculated by comparing the request success rate to defined [constraints](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/network-availability-monitors/create-a-nam-monitor#script-configuration-constraints "Learn how to set up a NAM monitor to check the performance and availability of your site."). A period when availability is 0% is called an outage.

  You can narrow the chart's time range to cover just the outage period. This allows you to identify, for example, requests that negatively impact availability. By default, the availability chart is collapsed when showing 0% or 100% for the whole time range. To open it, simply select **Availability**.
* **Success rate**âa chart of the success rate over time, where the success rate is the percentage of all executed requests that were sucessful.

  + See the [conditions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/network-availability-monitors/create-a-nam-monitor#script-configuration-constraints "Learn how to set up a NAM monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.") a request needs to meet to be considered successful.
  + Select the **Show requests** button under the chart to see availability changes such as the average performance, average availability, and packet success rate (this column is only available for ICMP).
* **Performance**âa chart of performance over time, where performance is calculated as an average for all successful requests. Note that performance metrics are not reported for failed requests.
* **Changes**âa history log that displays:

  + When the monitor was created and who created it.
  + Who changed the monitor properties, when the change was made, and which properties were changed in the selected timeframe.

# On-demand monitor executions

# On-demand monitor executions

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* 15-min read
* Updated on Jun 23, 2025

To trigger an execution via the web UI

1. In the upper-right corner of the monitor's details page, select **On-demand execution**.
2. From the **Locations** list, select the locations for which you want to trigger on-demand execution.

   Note that you can select a combination of **Assigned locations** and **Unassigned public locations** for this execution.
3. Select a **Processing mode**âthis applies to all selected locations for this execution.

   * **Standard** (default)âthe executions contribute to problem detection and availability and performance statistics. You can access execution results when you [**Analyze executions**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/browser-monitors-results-reporting#analyze-executions "Learn about the Browser details page for Browser monitors.").
   * **Disable problem detection**âthe executions contribute to availability and performance statistics but not to problem detection. You can view execution results when you [**Analyze executions**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/browser-monitors-results-reporting#analyze-executions "Learn about the Browser details page for Browser monitors.").
   * **Execution details only**âthe executions do not contribute to availability and performance statistics or to problem detection. You can still access results when you [**Analyze executions**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/browser-monitors-results-reporting#analyze-executions "Learn about the Browser details page for Browser monitors.").

   Note that for all processing modes, executions are visible in the list of on-demand executions in the web UI and retrieved via the [on-demand executions API](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/on-demand-executions#api "Execute synthetic monitors on demand from public or private locations").
4. **Fail on performance threshold violation**âby default, on-demand executions fail when they violate a performance threshold, given that their main purpose is to validate new software versions in your CI/CD pipeline. However, you can disable this setting so that on-demand executions behave like regularly scheduled executions (performance threshold violation does not cause this execution to fail but contributes to triggering the performance problem.).
5. **Trigger screenshot** (for browser monitors only)âfor a successful execution, the system takes a screenshot. To see the screenshot, go to [**Analyze executions**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/browser-monitors-results-reporting#analyze-executions "Learn about the Browser details page for Browser monitors.").

   **SSL issue handling** (for HTTP monitors only)âfail the monitor if one or more of its requests encounters an expired, missing, or expiring SSL certificate.
6. Select  **Trigger now**âsee a summary dialog listing the execution locations; the execution list displays new entries for the triggered executions. The **Execution stage** initially is `Triggered`.

   Any change you make to monitor script (configuration) is immediately available for on-demand executions on public or private locations.

   Note that executions might not all begin at the same time from different locationsâexecutions might take longer to begin from public locations than from private locations. See additional information on [throttling](#throttling) below.

#### Throttling and limits

* There is a mandatory gap per user of 60 seconds between consecutive on-demand executions of a monitor from the same location (whether triggered via the web UI or API).

  Examples of throttling

  All these examples assume execution from the same location.

  + User A triggers a monitor via API within 60 seconds of triggering the same monitor via UIâthrottled.
  + User B triggers a monitor via API within 60 seconds of user A triggering the same monitor via UIâno throttling.
  + User B triggers a monitor via UI within 60 seconds of user A triggering the same monitor via UIâno throttling.
  + User B triggers a monitor via API within 60 seconds of user A triggering the same monitor via APIâno throttling.
* When triggering multiple on-demand executions via the [API](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/on-demand-executions#api "Execute synthetic monitors on demand from public or private locations"), there is a limit of 100 executions per batch.
* + There's a limit of 5,000 on-demand executions per minute for a Dynatrace environment.
* You can define up to 64 key-value pairs of metadata per batch, where keys and values can each be up to 1,024 characters.

#### Failure to be triggered

On-demand executions might not be successfully triggered for various reasons, for example, when a monitor is disabled, a location is down, or when throttling is in effect for a monitor on a given location.

Additional reasons that on-demand executions might not be successfully triggered via the [API](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/on-demand-executions#api "Execute synthetic monitors on demand from public or private locations"): monitor deletion, incorrect specification of monitor or location IDs, incorrect specification of related service or application IDs, location deletion, problems with the public Synthetic infrastructure, or problems with your Dynatrace monitoring environment.

If an execution can't be successfully triggered via the web UI, the reasons are shown in the **Triggering status summary** after you select  **Trigger now**. The **Execution stage** in the execution list is `Not triggered`. Details of executions not triggered via the [API](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/on-demand-executions#api "Execute synthetic monitors on demand from public or private locations") are returned in the `triggeringProblemsCount` and `triggeringProblemsDetails` response parameters for the POST request.

Executions that can't be triggered are different from executions that are triggered but can't be executed. For details, see the [API](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/on-demand-executions#api "Execute synthetic monitors on demand from public or private locations") section.

#### List of executions

The list of executions shows all on-demand executions (triggered by any user via the web UI or API) for a given monitor within the selected time frame.

You need the DPS license to see the list of executions.

* **Execution ID** is a unique ID assigned to each execution; if you trigger executions from all locations, each location's execution has a different ID.
* **Triggered** shows the start time of the execution in the logged-in user's time zone.
* **Source** shows whether the execution was triggered via the web `UI` or the `API`.
* **User** is the Dynatrace user ID of the user who triggered the execution.
* **Location** is the name of the public or private location from which the monitor was executed.
* **Execution stage** identifies the different stages of the on-demand execution. The initial value is `Triggered` or `Not triggered`. When execution is complete, the value changes to `Executed`. Basic results such as duration and status code are available at this stage. The progress spinner continues to be displayed at the `Executed` stage until detailed results are available and the value changes to `Data retrieved`. If multiple sequential executions are triggered per location, the first execution is marked `Triggered`; the remaining executions are marked `Waiting`.
* **Result** indicates whether the execution was a `Success` or `Failure` (with an accompanying **Failure reason**).
* To view execution details, select the expand icon  in the first column.

# Install a Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate

# Install a Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Published Sep 09, 2025

Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate is used exclusively to run synthetic monitors. A clean ActiveGate installation for the purpose of synthetic monitoring disables all other ActiveGate features, including communication with OneAgents. Make sure the host on which you install the ActiveGate has access to the internet.

You can install a Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate from the **Install ActiveGate** wizard in ![Discovery & Coverage](https://dt-cdn.net/images/discovery-coverage-256-a20d5afa78.png "Discovery & Coverage") **Discovery & Coverage**.

1. In **Purpose**, choose **Synthetic**.
2. In **Deployment type**, choose the operating system.
3. Linux only In **Architecture**, keep the default selection: `x86`.
4. [**Generate token**](/docs/manage/identity-access-management/access-tokens-and-oauth-clients/access-tokens "Learn the concept of an access token and its scopes.") or enter an existing token. This token has the **Download OneAgent and ActiveGate installers** `InstallerDownload` token scope, which allows you to download the ActiveGate installer. Once provided, the token is automatically appended to download and installation commands, which are then displayed in the web UI.

   You can find existing tokens listed on the **Access tokens** page. Note that a token is only displayed once upon creation, after which it's stored encrypted and cannot be revealed. We recommend that you store the token after creation in a password manager so that you can reuse it as needed.
5. Optional Expand **Optional parameters** and:

   * Use the **Support browser monitors** switch to turn off support for browser monitors. If you do so, the Synthetic ActiveGate will be treated as [browserless](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations#browserless "Learn how to manage private locations in the Synthetic app.").
   * Assign the ActiveGate to a private Synthetic locationâchoose a location from the dropdown list or create a new one. You can also [assign the ActiveGate to a location](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations#create-private-location "Learn how to manage private locations in the Synthetic app.") after installation when creating or editing the location.
   * Assign the ActiveGate to a [**Network zone**](/docs/manage/network-zones "Find out how network zones work in Dynatrace.") and [**ActiveGate group**](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/activegate-group "Understand the basic concepts of ActiveGate groups."). You can also create a new network zone and ActiveGate group.
6. Download the installer to the target host.
7. Linux only Recommended **Verify signature**ârun the displayed command on the target host to download a certificate file and verify the installer.
8. Linux only Choose a Linux distribution and follow the instructions that precede the **Install ActiveGate as the privileged user** box if there are any.
9. Run the installer with the command provided in the **Install ActiveGate as the privileged user** box, and then follow the instructions displayed in the web UI.

   Linux only The installer automatically downloads Chromium and the dependencies required by the Synthetic engine. On Red Hat, Oracle Linux, and Rocky Linux, you also need to enable repositories from which the installer downloads the dependencies. As a prerequisite for enabling proprietary repositories on Red Hat, you need to register your Red Hat instance. The web UI provides you with all the required commands for doing so, as shown in the example below.

   If the web UIâguided installation fails or you prefer to prepare the host for the Synthetic engine yourself, you can install Chromium and other dependencies [manually or from a custom repository](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/install-chromium-for-linux "Learn how to install Chromium for Linux manually and from custom repositories.").

   ![Commands to install ActiveGate on Red Hat 9](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synth-ag-commands-red-hat-9-2025-04-24-813-39a89e370b.png)
10. Select **Show deployment status** to verify the ActiveGate installation.

# Install and update Chromium for Linux

# Install and update Chromium for Linux

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Updated on Jan 12, 2026

If the [web UIâguided installation](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/active-gate-for-private-locations-install#ui-guided-chromium-installation "Learn how to install Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates.") fails or you prefer to prepare the host for the Synthetic engine yourself, you can install Chromium and other dependencies [manually](#manual) or from a [custom repository](#custom-repo).

## Install Chromium and dependencies manually from S3

This section is not relevant for browserless locations.

Amazon Linux 2023, Ubuntu 24, and Oracle Linux 9

Amazon Linux 2023, Ubuntu 24, and Oracle Linux 9 use Chrome for Testing instead of Chromium. For manual installation of Chrome for Testing on these operating systems, see [Amazon Linux 2023, Ubuntu 24, and Oracle Linux 9 (Chrome for Testing)](#chrome-for-testing).

Ensure that you can connect to `https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com` to access Chromium and dependencies. For security reasons, public access to the S3 bucket is enabled only for specific files; trying anything else will result in a 403 error.

Also see [Install Chromium from a custom repository](#custom-repo) below.

See [how to update Chromium manually](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/install-chromium-for-linux#chromium-manual "Learn how to install Chromium for Linux manually and from custom repositories."). We strongly recommend that you keep your Linux-based Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates and Chromium versions updatedâDynatrace supports Chromium versions that are no more than two versions behind the [latest Dynatrace-supported version](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/requirements-for-private-synthetic#chromium-linux "Check system and hardware requirements for private Synthetic locations.") for a specific ActiveGate release.

### Ubuntu Server

1. Install Synthetic engine dependencies:

   Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04

   Synthetic engine dependencies:

   ```
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install xvfb x11-xkb-utils xfonts-100dpi xfonts-75dpi xfonts-scalable libnss3-tools auditd
   ```

   Chromium dependencies:

   ```
   sudo apt-get -y install fonts-dejavu-core
   ```

   ```
   sudo snap install gnome-3-38-2004 gtk-common-themes
   ```
2. Download and install Chromium.

   * Download the snap (Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04) package archive. This is a safe and verified archive hosted by Dynatrace.

     curl --output chromium.tgz https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/Chromium/snap/chromium-129.0.6668.89-2965.tgz
     ```

You can [verify the authenticity of the packages](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations#verify "Learn how to manage private locations in the Synthetic app.") using the signature files stored together with the package archives.

* Extract the installation packages. Go to the directory where you saved the archive and run the following command:

  ```
  mkdir /tmp/chromium ; tar xzf chromium.tgz -C /tmp/chromium
  ```

  This creates a `/tmp/chromium` directory and extracts the packages into it.
* Install the extracted packages.

  Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04

  ```
  sudo chown -R root:root /tmp/snap-private-tmp
  ```

  ```
  sudo snap ack /tmp/chromium/chromium.assert
  ```

  ```
  sudo snap install --devmode /tmp/chromium/chromium.snap
  ```

  Substitute `dtuserag` with the names of the ActiveGate service user and group if they differ from the default values.

  ```
  sudo chown -R dtuserag:dtuserag /tmp/snap-private-tmp
  ```

  This installs all the packages extracted to the `/tmp/chromium/` directory. You can delete the `/tmp/chromium/` directory and the downloaded `chromium.tgz` archive after successful Chromium installation.
* After you satisfy the dependencies, run the ActiveGate installer with root rights with the `--enable-synthetic` parameter set to `manual`. For example:

  ```
  /bin/bash ./Dynatrace-ActiveGate-Linux.sh --enable-synthetic=manual
  ```

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Oracle Linux, and Rocky Linux

* Chromium development for Red Hat/CentOS 7 and Amazon Linux 2 stopped at version 126.

  + Since Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 reached [End of Maintenanceï»¿](https://dt-url.net/af03uea) support on June 30, 2024, all of its packages have been archived. This means that it may not be possible to find the required dependencies for update. For more details, see the [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 statusï»¿](https://dt-url.net/e623zr1)
* Chromium installation when a proxy is required for internet access.

  + If you need to download and install Chromium, and your system requires a proxy for internet access, you should configure `curl`to use the correct proxy. Specify your proxy and port details by running the commands as in this example:

    ```
    vi /root/.curlrc



    proxy=http://proxy.example.com:8080
    ```

1. Set up repositories and install dependencies.

     Requires Chromium 130, previous version `129.0.6668.89-1.el9` cannot be installed anymore, please refer to [troubleshooting guideï»¿](https://dt-url.net/x303x5f) for details.

     ```
     curl --output chromium.tgz https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/Chromium/rpm/chromium-130.0.6723.116-1.el9.tgz
     ```

   You can [verify the authenticity of the packages](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations#verify "Learn how to manage private locations in the Synthetic app.") using the signature files stored together with the package archives.

   * Extract the installation packages. Go to the directory where you saved the archive and run the following command:

     ```
     mkdir /tmp/chromium ; tar xzf chromium.tgz -C /tmp/chromium
     ```

     This creates a `/tmp/chromium` directory and extract the packages into it.
   * Install extracted packages.

     ```
     sudo yum install -y /tmp/chromium/*.rpm
     ```

     This installs all the packages extracted to the `/tmp/chromium/` directory. You can delete the `/tmp/chromium/` directory and the downloaded `chromium.tgz` archive after successful Chromium installation.
3. Disable automatic update of Chromium packages:

   ```
   sudo yum -y install yum-plugin-versionlock



   sudo yum versionlock chromium



   sudo yum versionlock chromium-common
   ```
4. Optional Install non-Latin TrueType fonts:

   ```
   sudo yum install dejavu-fonts-common.noarch dejavu-sans-fonts.noarch
   ```
5. After you satisfy the dependencies, run the ActiveGate installer with root rights with the `--enable-synthetic` parameter set to `manual`. For example:

   ```
   /bin/bash ./Dynatrace-ActiveGate-Linux.sh --enable-synthetic=manual
   ```

### Amazon Linux 2023, Ubuntu 24, and Oracle Linux 9 (Chrome for Testing)

Unlike Chromium on other distributions, Chrome for Testing updates do not use package managers. You manually manage the Chrome binaries while dependencies are managed by the system package manager.

See [how to update Chrome for Testing manually](#chromium-manual). We strongly recommend that you keep your Linux-based Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates and Chrome for Testing versions updatedâDynatrace supports Chrome for Testing versions that are no more than two versions behind the [latest Dynatrace-supported version](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/requirements-for-private-synthetic#chromium-linux "Check system and hardware requirements for private Synthetic locations.") for a specific ActiveGate release.

1. Set up repositories and install dependencies.

   Ubuntu 24

   Amazon Linux 2023

   Oracle Linux 9

   * Install Synthetic engine dependencies:

     ```
     sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install xvfb x11-xkb-utils xfonts-100dpi xfonts-75dpi xfonts-scalable libnss3-tools auditd unzip
     ```
   * Install Chrome for Testing dependencies:

     ```
     sudo apt-get -y install libasound2t64 libatk-bridge2.0-0t64 libatk1.0-0t64 libcairo2 libcups2t64 libgbm1 libnspr4 libnss3 libpango-1.0-0 libxcomposite1 libxdamage1 libxfixes3 libxkbcommon0 libxrandr2
     ```

   * Enable `EPEL` (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux):

     ```
     sudo yum install -y epel-release
     ```
   * Install Synthetic engine dependencies:

     ```
     sudo yum install -y xorg-x11-server-Xvfb xorg-x11-xkb-utils xorg-x11-server-utils xorg-x11-fonts-100dpi xorg-x11-fonts-75dpi xorg-x11-fonts-Type1 libwayland-server mesa-libgbm curl nss-tools unzip
     ```
   * Install Chrome for Testing dependencies:

     ```
     sudo yum install -y alsa-lib at-spi2-atk atk cairo cups-libs dbus-libs libXcomposite libXdamage libXrandr libxkbcommon mesa-libgbm nspr nss pango
     ```

   * Enable `EPEL` (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux):

     ```
     sudo yum install -y oracle-epel-release-el9
     ```
   * Install Synthetic engine dependencies:

     ```
     sudo yum install -y xorg-x11-server-Xvfb xkbcomp xorg-x11-server-utils xorg-x11-fonts-100dpi xorg-x11-fonts-75dpi xorg-x11-fonts-Type1 libwayland-server mesa-libgbm curl nss-tools unzip
     ```
   * Install Chrome for Testing dependencies:

     ```
     sudo yum install -y alsa-lib at-spi2-atk atk cairo cups-libs libXcomposite libXdamage libXrandr libxkbcommon mesa-libgbm nspr nss pango
     ```
2. Download and set up Chrome for Testing.

   * Create the Chrome for Testing directory:

     ```
     sudo mkdir -p /usr/lib/chrome_for_testing
     ```
   * Download the Chrome for Testing package archive to a temporary location. This is a safe and verified archive hosted by Dynatrace.

     ActiveGate version 1.329

     ```
     curl --output /tmp/chrome.zip https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/Chrome/chrome-for-testing-linux64/chrome-for-testing-linux64-142.0.7444.175.zip
     ```

     ActiveGate version 1.327

     ```
     curl --output /tmp/chrome.zip https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/Chrome/chrome-for-testing-linux64/chrome-for-testing-linux64-141.0.7390.122.zip
     ```

     You can [verify the authenticity of the packages](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations#verify "Learn how to manage private locations in the Synthetic app.") using the signature files stored together with the package archives.
   * Extract the installation package and clean up:

     ```
     sudo unzip /tmp/chrome.zip -d /usr/lib/chrome_for_testing



     rm /tmp/chrome.zip
     ```

     This creates a `chrome-linux64` directory inside `/usr/lib/chrome_for_testing` and extracts the Chrome binary and supporting files into it.
   * Verify Chrome for Testing by checking the version:

     ```
     /usr/lib/chrome_for_testing/chrome-linux64/chrome --version
     ```

     Command output should show the Chrome version you downloaded.
3. After you satisfy the dependencies, run the ActiveGate installer with root rights. The installer will automatically detect and validate Chrome for Testing. For example:

   ```
   /bin/bash ./Dynatrace-ActiveGate-Linux.sh --enable-synthetic=manual
   ```

   Custom Chrome for Testing directory: If you want to use a different directory than the default `/usr/lib/chrome_for_testing`, specify it by setting the `synthetic_chrome_for_testing_path` property in the `custom.properties` file after installation. The new directory will be used after the upgrade of Synthetic module.

   Chrome for Testing files are preserved during ActiveGate uninstallation. If you uninstall the ActiveGate, the Chrome for Testing directory and its contents will remain on the system and can be reused during reinstallation.

## Update Chromium manually from S3

You might want to update Chromium and dependencies manually if you have an offline environment. If you've installed an ActiveGate manually, say, for manual dependency management because of constraints in accessing the Amazon S3 service, you'll want to update Chromium manually.

You need to update Chromium manually per ActiveGate, and the process varies slightly based on the operating system. Note that manual update of Chromium only applies to Linux-based ActiveGates; on Windows-based ActiveGates, Chromium is automatically updated during Synthetic engine updates.

Prerequisites:

* Ensure that [**Enable Chromium auto-update**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations#chromium-autoupdate "Learn how to manage private locations in the Synthetic app.") is turned off for your private location. If you disable autoupdate for a location, you need to update Chromium manually on every ActiveGate assigned to that location.
* Ensure that you can connect to `https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com` to access Chromium and dependencies.

* The Synthetic engine will use the new Chromium version after the update is completeânote that the status is updated once every hour, so it may take up to an hour to refresh the Chromium version displayed for your ActiveGate in **Deployment Status**.
* We strongly recommend that you keep your Linux-based Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates and Chromium versions updatedâDynatrace supports Chromium versions that are no more than two versions behind the [latest Dynatrace-supported version](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/requirements-for-private-synthetic#chromium-linux "Check system and hardware requirements for private Synthetic locations.") for a specific ActiveGate release.
* We strongly recommend updating all ActiveGates per location to the same version.
* See also [Chromium autoupdate from a custom repository](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/install-chromium-for-linux#autoupdate-custom-repo "Learn how to install Chromium for Linux manually and from custom repositories.").

Ubuntu Server

Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS

Amazon Linux 2023, Ubuntu 24, and Oracle Linux 9 (Chrome for Testing)

1. If your ActiveGate and Chromium versions haven't been updated in a while, you might want to check and install Synthetic engine and Chromium dependencies again. See the [manual installation instructions for Ubuntu Server](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/install-chromium-for-linux#ubuntu "Learn how to install Chromium for Linux manually and from custom repositories.").
2. Download the snap (Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04) package archive. This is a safe and verified archive hosted by Dynatrace at `https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com`. Be sure to use the specific command provided for your ActiveGate and Ubuntu Server versions in the [manual installation instructions for Ubuntu Server](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/install-chromium-for-linux#ubuntu "Learn how to install Chromium for Linux manually and from custom repositories.").
3. Extract and install the downloaded packages. Be sure to use the correct installation command for your Ubuntu Server version (check the [manual installation instructions for Ubuntu Server](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/install-chromium-for-linux#ubuntu "Learn how to install Chromium for Linux manually and from custom repositories.")).
4. Verify Chromium update by running the following command from the default installation directory. Command output should match the Chromium version you installed.

   ```
   /opt/dynatrace/synthetic/browser --version
   ```

Updating Chromium manually is identical on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS, the only difference being the downloaded packages for Red Hat/CentOS version 7 and version 8.

If you've installed Chromium manually, there's no need at the time of the update to register the Red Hat instance in the subscription manager or to enable the Red Hat repositories or EPEL packages.

1. If your ActiveGate and Chromium versions haven't been updated in a while, you might want to install Synthetic engine dependencies again. See the [manual installation instructions for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS](#redhat).
2. Download the rpm package archive. This is a safe and verified archive hosted by Dynatrace at `https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com`. Be sure to use the specific command provided for your ActiveGate and OS versions in the [manual installation instructions for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS](#redhat).
3. Extract and install the downloaded packages. Check the [manual installation instructions for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS](#redhat).
4. If necessary, disable the automatic update of Chromium packages. Note that for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS, packing locking, once performed, remains persistent across all future updates.

   ```
   sudo yum -y install yum-plugin-versionlock



   sudo yum versionlock chromium



   sudo yum versionlock chromium-common
   ```
5. Verify Chromium update by running the following command from the default installation directory. Command output should match the Chromium version you installed.

   ```
   /opt/dynatrace/synthetic/browser --version
   ```

Chrome for Testing is managed differently than Chromium. Manual updates are performed by downloading and extracting the new version to the Chrome for Testing directory.

Unlike Chromium on other distributions, Chrome for Testing updates do not use package managers. You manually manage the Chrome binaries while dependencies are managed by the system package manager.

1. If your ActiveGate and Chrome for Testing versions haven't been updated in a while, you might want to check and install Synthetic engine and Chrome for Testing dependencies again. See the [manual installation instructions for Chrome for Testing](#chrome-for-testing).
2. Download the Chrome for Testing package archive to a temporary location. This is a safe and verified archive hosted by Dynatrace at `https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com`. Be sure to use the specific command provided for your ActiveGate version in the [manual installation instructions for Chrome for Testing](#chrome-for-testing), but modify the output path to `/tmp/chrome.zip`.
3. Remove the old Chrome for Testing directory, extract the new version, and clean up:

   ```
   sudo rm -rf /usr/lib/chrome_for_testing/chrome-linux64



   sudo unzip /tmp/chrome.zip -d /usr/lib/chrome_for_testing



   rm /tmp/chrome.zip
   ```

   If you configured a custom Chrome for Testing directory via the `synthetic_chrome_for_testing_path` property in `custom.properties`, replace `/usr/lib/chrome_for_testing` with your custom path in the commands above.
4. Verify Chrome for Testing update by running the following command. Command output should match the Chrome version you installed.

   ```
   /usr/lib/chrome_for_testing/chrome-linux64/chrome --version
   ```

   The Synthetic engine will use the new Chrome for Testing version immediately. Note that the status is updated once every hour, so it may take up to an hour to refresh the Chrome version displayed for your ActiveGate in **Deployment Status**.

## Install Chromium from a custom repository

ActiveGate version 1.243+ In addition to [web UI-guided ActiveGate installation](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/active-gate-for-private-locations-install "Learn how to install Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates.") and [manual installation of Chromium and dependencies](#manual), you can also **install ActiveGate by pointing to a custom, local repository for Chromium components**. As this repository is an HTTP server that you set up within your network, the advantage of this method is that it can be used in environments with intranet-only or limited network access.

This method of installing Chromium broadly consists of:

* Downloading the required Dynatrace-hosted deb, snap, or rpm package archives and their corresponding signature files.
* Installing and running a locally hosted web server where the downloaded Chromium components reside.
* Downloading and running the ActiveGate installer on the target host with an environment variable pointing to the location of the custom repository on the HTTP server.

* A custom Chromium repository can be used only for Chromium components, not their dependencies. Installing Chromium from a custom repository will only work if all dependencies have been resolved before installation.
* Custom repositories can only be used for **Chromium installation and autoupdate**âsee [Chromium autoupdate from a custom repository](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/install-chromium-for-linux#autoupdate-custom-repo "Learn how to install Chromium for Linux manually and from custom repositories.") for details.

1. Download the Chromium componentsâthe package archive and signature fileâfrom the safe and verified archive hosted by Dynatrace. See [Requirements for private Synthetic locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/requirements-for-private-synthetic "Check system and hardware requirements for private Synthetic locations.") for links to the latest supported and provided Chromium versions.

   We recommend keeping your Linux-based Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates and Chromium versions up to date; choose the latest provided Chromium version for ActiveGate.

   For example, for ActiveGate version 1.255 on Ubuntu 22. the required files are:

   * Package archiveâ`https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/Chromium/snap/chromium-107.0.5304.87-2168.tgz`
   * Signature fileâ`https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/Chromium/snap/chromium-107.0.5304.87-2168.tgz.sig`

   The corresponding download commands are:

   ```
   curl -o chromium-107.0.5304.87-2168.tgz https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/Chromium/snap/chromium-107.0.5304.87-2168.tgz
   ```

   ```
   curl -o chromium-107.0.5304.87-2168.tgz.sig https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/Chromium/snap/chromium-107.0.5304.87-2168.tgz.sig
   ```
2. Install a web server of your choice and create a directory, for example, `chromium-repo`, to serve the Chromium components to the ActiveGate host. Copy the downloaded Chromium components to this directory.
3. Download the ActiveGate installer from Dynatrace Hub.
4. Resolve all dependencies and enable repositories as required as shown in [Install Chromium and dependencies manually from S3](#manual) above. The custom repository can be used only for Chromium packages, not their dependencies.
5. Install the ActiveGate with the Synthetic module enabled (`--enable-synthetic`) and the `DYNATRACE_SYNTHETIC_CUSTOM_CHROMIUM_REPO` environment variable pointing to the location of the custom repository (`https://172.18.0.100/chromium-repo` in this example).

   ```
   sudo DYNATRACE_SYNTHETIC_CUSTOM_CHROMIUM_REPO=http://172.18.0.100:8000/chromium-repo  /bin/bash Dynatrace-ActiveGate-Linux-x86-1.257.0.20221129-155835.sh --enable-synthetic
   ```

   You can use the hostname of the HTTP server instead of the IP address so long as the ActiveGate host can resolve the hostname.

Once you've installed Chromium in this way from a custom repository, it can only be autoupdated. See [Chromium autoupdate from a custom repository](#autoupdate-custom-repo) for details and update alternatives.

## Chromium autoupdate from a custom repository

If you've enabled a [custom, local repository for Chromium installation](#custom-repo), Chromium can only be autoupdated. Follow this procedure to autoupdate Chromium via the same custom repository.

1. After ActiveGate installation, specify the custom repository of the ActiveGate in the [`[synthetic]` section of the `custom.properties` file](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/configuration/configure-activegate#synth_mod "Learn which ActiveGate properties you can configure based on your needs and requirements.") in the `/var/lib/dynatrace/gateway/config` directory. This allows for automatic Chromium updates from the custom repository during manual or automatic Synthetic engine updates.

   ```
   [synthetic]



   chromium_repo = https://172.18.0.100/chromium-repo
   ```
2. Turn on [**Enable Chromium auto-update**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations#chromium-autoupdate "Learn how to manage private locations in the Synthetic app.") for your private location.

   Note that the Chromium autoupdate UI setting applies to all ActiveGates assigned to your private location.
3. Ensure that the Chromium components required for update are available at the custom repository location. Chromium is then automatically updated from the custom repository during ActiveGate and Synthetic engine updates.

Chromium autoupdate option

If you do not specify the custom repository in `custom.properties`, Chromium is downloaded and updated from S3 during a manual or automatic ActiveGate and Synthetic engine update.

## Custom Chromium version

You can install a custom Chromium version, that is, override the Chromium version that the ActiveGate installer looks for. This is applicable for manual ActiveGate installation, as described in [Chromium installation via S3](#manual) or via a [custom repository](#custom-repo).

In this command for manual ActiveGate installation via S3, an environment variable points to an explicit Chromium version number `107.0.5304.87-2168`, which is part of the package archive for Ubuntu 20 or 22.

```
sudo /bin/bash -c "export DYNATRACE_SYNTHETIC_EXPLICIT_CHROMIUM_VERSION=107.0.5304.87-2168; /bin/bash Dynatrace-ActiveGate-Linux-x86-1.257.0.20221129-155835.sh --enable-synthetic"
```

This command searches for the Chromium version `107.0.5304.87-2168` in the custom repository `https://172.18.0.100/chromium-repo`.

```
sudo DYNATRACE_SYNTHETIC_EXPLICIT_CHROMIUM_VERSION=107.0.5304.87-2168 DYNATRACE_SYNTHETIC_CUSTOM_CHROMIUM_REPO=http://172.18.0.100:8000/chromium-repo  /bin/bash Dynatrace-ActiveGate-Linux-x86-1.257.0.20221129-155835.sh --enable-synthetic
```

# Manage private locations

# Manage private locations

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Updated on Dec 12, 2025

To view and manage private locations, go to the **Private locations** tab in ![Synthetic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-new-256-1ddb35ac79.png "Synthetic") **Synthetic**.

## Health status

In the **Health status** column of the **Private Synthetic locations** list, you can see ActiveGates health status for each private location in your environment. The column has three sub-columns:

* **Health alerts**âthe alerts display reasons behind ActiveGates health issues. The alerts are also highlighted with colored indicators depending on issues severity:

  + Yellow:

    - Capacityâthe capacity usage of a least one monitor type is more than 80%.
    - No redundancyâthere is only one ActiveGate assigned to the location. No backup in case the ActiveGate is down.
    - Compatibilityâat least one ActiveGate doesn't support at least one monitor type assigned to the location. For details, point to the  (**Warning**) in the **Assigned monitors** column.
  + Red:

    - Capacityâthe capacity usage of at least one monitor type is greater than 90%.
    - Offline AGâat least one ActiveGate is down.
    - Offline locationâthe private location is down. It happens when no ActiveGates are assigned to the private location.
    - Discardedâthere is at least one discarded monitor execution in the last 30 minutes.
* **ActiveGates**ânumber of ActiveGates assigned to a location by their health status. Health status is indicated by one of the following colors:

  + Greenâno ActiveGates with issues.
  + Yellowâone or more ActiveGates experience issues that are still not serious but might require attention.
  + Redâone or more ActiveGates experience serious issues that require immediate attention.
* **Assigned monitors**âthe type and number of Synthetic monitors assigned to the location. The number of HTTP monitors also includes HTTP High Resource monitors.

![ActiveGates health status](https://dt-cdn.net/images/screenshot-2025-12-08-163344-1471-088b434222.png)

## See location details and edit location

Select a location to see its details and edit it. For classic locations, you can see ActiveGates assigned to the locations. They are listed and displayed in red when a Synthetic engine or an ActiveGate itself is offline; the **Status** column shows a corresponding message.

You can see the **ActiveGate ID** in the column that is hidden by default. To display it, select the columns  icon > **ActiveGate ID** > **Apply**.

You can add or delete ActiveGates from the location details page. You can also make other changes and select **Save** to save them.

### Diagnostics

The **Diagnostics** card displays the health status for each monitor type.

* **Capacity usage**âthe capacity usage for a monitor type. If the capacity usage is less than 80%, `OK` is displayed in the column, and if there is no data, `0` is displayed.
* **Compatibility**âthe number of ActiveGates that support a monitor type. For example, if there are three ActiveGates assigned to the location, but only two of them support the monitor type, you will see `2/3`.
* **Monitors**âthe number of monitors by type assigned to the location.
* **Executions/hour**âthe number of executions per hour for a monitor type.
* **ActiveGates**âthe number of ActiveGates assigned to the location. This also includes the number of those ActiveGates that are offline. For example, if there are three ActiveGates assigned to the location, but one of them is offline, you will see `1/3`.

For **Capacity usage**, **Compatibility**, and **ActiveGates**, the health status is additionally indicated by one of the following colors:

* Greenâno issues.
* Yellowâthere are issues that are not yet serious but might require attention.
* Redâthere are serious issues that require immediate attention.

### Metrics for health status

Metrics for the health status of each monitor type are available for charting and alerting. Metrics for charting and alerting on the health status of each monitor type are available in [![Notebooks](https://dt-cdn.net/images/notebooks-768-046137830a.webp "Notebooks") **Notebooks**](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/dashboards-and-notebooks/notebooks "Analyze, visualize, and share insights from your observability dataâall in one collaborative, customizable workspace."). For example, you can choose the following metrics for charting and alerting:

* Synthetic - HTTP - Engine Utilization
* Synthetic - HTTP High Resource - Engine Utilization
* Synthetic - Browser - Engine Utilization

We strongly recommend splitting these metrics by location to get an accurate view of location health.

![Metric_for_private_location](https://dt-cdn.net/images/screenshot-2025-07-02-201338-1377-bb0711152b.png)

## Location outage handling

For each location, enable the corresponding switches to generate problems when a location or any of its ActiveGate engines are unavailable. The following switches are currently available:

* You can generate a problem when the entire private location is unavailable (all ActiveGates are offline), or if the location lacks the capability required for the monitor type to be executed.
* You can generate a problem when a single ActiveGate at this location is offline.

For example, suppose your location has two ActiveGates, and you enable both problem switches. You will see three problems when your location is unavailableâone for the entire location and one for each ActiveGate that's offline.

Containerized locations

For containerized locations, you can only generate a problem when the entire private location is unavailable (all ActiveGates are offline), or if the location lacks the capability required for the monitor type to be executed.

# Proxy for private locations

# Proxy for private locations

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Published Sep 11, 2025

You can incorporate [proxies, load balancers, and reverse proxies in your Dynatrace deployment](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/supported-connectivity-schemes-for-activegates#proxies "Learn about the connectivity priorities between ActiveGate types as well as the priorities between ActiveGates and OneAgents."). In particular, your ActiveGate configuration allows you to define one or more proxies for outgoing connections.

* To set up a proxy for communication with the tested resource, edit the [`custom.properties`](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/configuration/configure-activegate "Learn which ActiveGate properties you can configure based on your needs and requirements.") file and set properties in the `[synthetic]` section.
* To set up a proxy only for internal communication with the Dynatrace Cluster, see [settings for Dynatrace Cluster communication only](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/configuration/set-up-proxy-authentication-for-activegate#internal "Learn how to configure ActiveGate properties to set up a proxy.").
* To set up the same proxy for both a tested resource and the Dynatrace Cluster, set properties in the `[http.client]` section.

## Proxy configuration properties

You can use the following properties when configuring a proxy for your Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate:

Property

Description

`proxy-server`

Server address (hostname or IP address)

`proxy-port`

Port Optional

If left empty, the default `8080` port is used.

`proxy-scheme`

Scheme Optional

If left empty, the default `http` scheme is used. This applies the most common setup, where the connection to the proxy is initiated using HTTP and automatically upgraded to a secure one. All further ActiveGate communication through the proxy is secured by SSL/TLS.

Must be set to `https` for proxies that do not support HTTP at all.

`proxy-user`

User name Optional

`proxy-domain`

User domain in the case of NTLM authentication

`proxy-password`

Password Optional

The password provided in the `proxy-password` property is obfuscated after ActiveGate restart, and the obfuscated password is stored in the `proxy-password-encr` property.

If a comma (`,`) is part of a value, you need to add an escape backslash (`\`) before the comma. For example, `proxy-password = foo\,bar`.

`proxy-off`

If set to `true`, causes proxy to be disabled for the particular type of communication.

`proxy-non-proxy-hosts`

A list of hosts for communication with which proxy should not be used by ActiveGate

The hosts in the list should be separated by `|` characters. You can also use an asterisk `*` as a wildcard character to match any string. There can be only one wildcard character, either at the beginning or the end of the hostname. For example, `proxy-non-proxy-hosts=*.foo.com|localhost` indicates that every host in the `foo.com` domain and the `localhost` should be accessed directly even if a proxy server is specified. For a full description of allowed syntax, see the syntax for the `http.nonProxyHosts` parameter in [Networking Propertiesï»¿](https://dt-url.net/kk02v8r).

`proxy-authentication-schemes`

ActiveGate version 1.271+

A list of proxy authentication schemes Optional

This is a prioritized list of proxy authentication schemes that ActiveGate should use when authenticating with the proxy server.

* Starting with the first scheme on the list, ActiveGate will attempt to authenticate and, in case of failure, proceed to the next scheme on the list.
* If this property is not defined, ActiveGate will try to authenticate using all available schemes.

Supported values: `NTLM`, `BASIC`

## Proxy connection scenarios

These are the possible scenarios for your proxy configuration. Access to tested resource via proxy is only supported for browser monitors and http monitors.

### Connect to the Dynatrace Cluster

```
[http.client]



proxy-server=<proxy>



proxy-port=8080



proxy-user=username



proxy-password=password



[synthetic]



proxy-off=true
```

### Connect to both the Dynatrace Cluster and tested resource

```
[http.client]



proxy-server=<proxy>



proxy-port=8080



proxy-user=username



proxy-password=password
```

### Connect to the Dynatrace Cluster and tested resources via different proxies

* Connect to the Dynatrace Cluster

  ```
  [http.client]



  proxy-server=<proxy>



  proxy-port=8080



  proxy-user=username



  proxy-password=password
  ```
* Connect to the tested resource

  ```
  [synthetic]



  proxy-server=<proxy between AG and tested resource>



  proxy-port=9090



  proxy-user=username_two



  proxy-password=password_two
  ```

### Connect to the tested resource and/or Amazon S3

The Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate needs access to the Amazon S3 service to upload and access screenshots for browser monitors on private locations.

```
[synthetic]



proxy-server=<proxy between AG and tested resource>



proxy-port=8080



proxy-user=username



proxy-password=password
```

For more information, see [Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) files](#proxy-auto-configuration-pac-files).

### Configure synthetic monitoring with direct connection to other resources

```
[synthetic]



proxy-server=<proxy between AG and tested resource>



proxy-port=8080



proxy-user=username



proxy-password=password



proxy-non-proxy-hosts=my.corp.org|*.gdansk.dynatrace.com
```

## Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) files

You can use Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) files to handle complex proxy configuration for private browser monitors.

### What is a PAC file?

A Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) file is a JavaScript function that determines whether web browser requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP) go directly to the destination or are forwarded to a web proxy server (for details, see [Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) fileï»¿](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Proxy_servers_and_tunneling/Proxy_Auto-Configuration_%28PAC%29_file) on [developer.mozilla.orgï»¿](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)).

### Provide a PAC file to your browser monitors

1. Go to ![Synthetic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-new-256-1ddb35ac79.png "Synthetic") **Synthetic**.
2. Optional To filter the table for browser monitors, select **Browser** under **Filter options** on the left.
3. From the list of browser monitors, select the monitor for which you want to provide a PAC file. This displays a preview panel on the right.
4. Select **Edit** in the upper-right of the preview panel.

   From this point, you're redirected to previous Dynatrace where you can provide a PAC file URL.
5. Switch to the [script mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/script-mode-for-browser-monitor-configuration "Create or edit your browser monitors in JSON format.").

   * For a clickpath, select **Recorded clickpath** > **Script**.
   * For a single-URL monitor, select **Monitor script**.
6. Add the following to the `configuration` object of the JSON file:

   ```
   "proxy": {



   "pacUrl": "https://www.example.com/test.pac"



   }
   ```

   `pacUrl` points to your hosted PAC file.

   ![Add a PAC file to a browser monitor.](https://dt-cdn.net/images/screenshot-2025-09-18-145741-826-11ee737f0f.png)

   For more information on script mode, see [Script mode for browser monitor configuration](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/script-mode-for-browser-monitor-configuration "Create or edit your browser monitors in JSON format.").

### PAC file configuration compatibility

* PAC file configuration only applies to private Synthetic locations, not public locations.
* PAC file configuration applies only to the monitor you configureâeach individual monitor must have the PAC file configured in its script; there is no global setting for all monitors to use a PAC file for proxy services.

* When you set a PAC file proxy for one synthetic monitor script, it only applies to that monitor.

* If a PAC file is specified, it overrides the proxy settings specified at the ActiveGate level for communication with the tested resource. Specifically, it overrides the properties in the `[synthetic]` section.
* The PAC file must be served via HTTP/S.

## Proxy configuration for FIPS mode

When Synthetic location is installed in FIPS mode, browser monitor traffic must be routed through local intercepting proxy, so that all traffic leaving the host is encrypted with a crypto library that is FIPS-certified:

![FIPS proxy](https://dt-cdn.net/images/syn-proxy-for-fips-811-26fb991173.png)

In this example setup, we use the Squid proxy linked to the system's OpenSSL library, but you can use different proxy software as long as its crypto library is FIPS-certified.

1. Install proxy on the same host as Synthetic engine:

   Red Hat

   Ubuntu Pro

   ```
   sudo dnf install squid
   ```

   ```
   sudo apt install squid-openssl
   ```
2. Provide CA certificate for [re-signingï»¿](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/DynamicSslCert) intercepted requests:

   Red Hat

   Ubuntu Pro

   ```
   sudo mkdir /etc/squid/ssl_cert



   sudo mv ~/prepared_ca_cert.pem /etc/squid/ssl_cert/squid.pem



   sudo chown --recursive squid:squid /etc/squid/ssl_cert



   sudo chmod 700 /etc/squid/ssl_cert



   sudo chmod 600 /etc/squid/ssl_cert/squid.pem
   ```

   ```
   sudo mkdir /etc/squid/ssl_cert



   sudo mv ~/prepared_ca_cert.pem /etc/squid/ssl_cert/squid.pem



   sudo chown --recursive proxy:proxy /etc/squid/ssl_cert



   sudo chmod 700 /etc/squid/ssl_cert



   sudo chmod 600 /etc/squid/ssl_cert/squid.pem
   ```

   If SELinux is enabled, you might need to adjust [file labelsï»¿](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/selinux_users_and_administrators_guide/sect-security-enhanced_linux-working_with_selinux-selinux_contexts_labeling_files) to avoid permission errors.
3. Create temporary certificate cache:

   Red Hat

   Ubuntu Pro

   ```
   sudo /usr/lib64/squid/security_file_certgen -c -s /var/spool/squid/ssl_db -M 4MB



   sudo chown --recursive squid:squid /var/spool/squid/ssl_db
   ```

   ```
   sudo /usr/lib/squid/security_file_certgen -c -s /var/spool/squid/ssl_db -M 4MB



   sudo chown --recursive proxy:proxy /var/spool/squid/ssl_db
   ```
4. Configure the proxy to perform [SSL interceptionï»¿](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslPeekAndSplice) (by default, `/etc/squid/squid.conf`):

   ```
   acl SSL_ports port 443



   acl Safe_ports port 80 443 1025-65535



   acl CONNECT method CONNECT



   http_access deny !Safe_ports



   http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_ports



   http_access allow localhost



   http_access deny all



   http_port 3128 ssl-bump generate-host-certificates=on dynamic_cert_mem_cache_size=4MB cert=/etc/squid/ssl_cert/squid.pem



   acl step1 at_step SslBump1



   ssl_bump peek step1



   ssl_bump bump all



   cache deny all
   ```
5. Restart the proxy for configuration to take effect:

   ```
   sudo systemctl enable squid



   sudo systemctl restart squid
   ```
6. Verify that proxy is working correctly:

   ```
   curl --proxy localhost:3128 https://example.com
   ```
7. Optional If you chose a different proxy port, you need to adjust Synthetic configuration (by default, `/var/lib/dynatrace/synthetic/config/user.properties`):

   ```
   com.vuc.fips.proxy.port=3128
   ```

### Proxy configuration for FIPS mode with corporate proxy

If your organization mandates use of a corporate proxy, you need to set up a second local Squid instance due to limitations of Squid:

![FIPS proxy chain](https://dt-cdn.net/images/syn-proxy-for-fips-upstream-1141-ebd20f3425.png)

If you're using a different proxy software, this might not be applicable to you.

1. Configure proxy for FIPS, as described in the previous section.

   Squid version `5+` is required, so Red Hat version `8` and Ubuntu version `20` aren't supported.
2. On the same host, create a second squid service definition:

   Red Hat

   Ubuntu Pro

   `/usr/lib/systemd/system/squid2.service`

   ```
   [Unit]



   Description=Squid with upstream proxy



   After=network.target network-online.target nss-lookup.target



   [Service]



   Type=notify



   LimitNOFILE=16384



   PIDFile=/run/squid2.pid



   ExecStart=/usr/sbin/squid --foreground -n squid2 -f "/etc/squid/squid2.conf"



   ExecReload=/usr/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID



   KillMode=mixed



   NotifyAccess=all



   [Install]



   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

   `/lib/systemd/system/squid2.service`

   ```
   [Unit]



   Description=Squid with upstream proxy



   After=network.target network-online.target nss-lookup.target



   [Service]



   Type=notify



   PIDFile=/run/squid2.pid



   Group=proxy



   RuntimeDirectory=squid2



   RuntimeDirectoryMode=0775



   ExecStart=/usr/sbin/squid --foreground -sYC -n squid2 -f "/etc/squid/squid2.conf"



   ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID



   KillMode=mixed



   NotifyAccess=all



   [Install]



   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```
3. Create a second proxy configuration (`/etc/squid/squid2.conf`) and provide your corporate proxy host, port and [authenticationï»¿](https://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/cache_peer):

   ```
   acl SSL_ports port 443



   acl Safe_ports port 80 443 1025-65535



   acl CONNECT method CONNECT



   http_access deny !Safe_ports



   http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_ports



   http_access allow localhost



   http_access deny all



   http_port 3129



   access_log daemon:/var/log/squid/access2.log squid



   cache_log /var/log/squid/cache2.log



   pid_filename /run/squid2.pid



   cache_peer upstream-proxy.example.com parent 443 0 default no-digest proxy-only login=proxyuser:proxypass tls tls-min-version=1.2 tls-options=NO_SSLv3



   never_direct allow all



   visible_hostname squid2



   cache deny all
   ```
4. Update first proxy configuration (`/etc/squid/squid.conf`) to use the second proxy as [parent proxyï»¿](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/CacheHierarchy) by appending the following lines:

   ```
   cache_peer localhost parent 3129 0 default no-digest proxy-only



   never_direct allow all



   visible_hostname squid1
   ```
5. Restart both squid services:

   ```
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload



   sudo systemctl enable squid2



   sudo systemctl start squid2



   sudo systemctl restart squid
   ```
6. Verify that proxy chain is working correctly:

   ```
   curl --proxy localhost:3128 https://example.com

### Resource considerations

* Each Squid service requires an additional 500 MiB of RAM, which needs to be taken into account when choosing instance size for a particular workload.
* Requests going through multiple proxies will take longer, so performance metrics will be worse than those from a non-FIPS instance.

# Requirements for private Synthetic locations

# Requirements for private Synthetic locations

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Updated on Jan 13, 2026

Ensure that the host you want to use for your private location complies with the following requirements.

End-of-support information

There are no new versions of Chromium for Red Hat/Oracle Linux/Rocky Linux 8 beyond version 133. For important security and stability reasons, we've decided to discontinue our support for installing **Synthetic-enabled** ActiveGate on Red Hat/Oracle Linux/Rocky Linux 8 after ActiveGate version 1.325.

To ensure the continuity and security of your synthetic monitors, we recommend migrating your Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate to one of the [supported operating systems](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/system-and-hardware-requirements-for-private-synthetic#linux-supported-os "Supported operating systems, Chromium versions, and hardware requirements for running synthetic monitors from private locations"), for example, Red Hat/Oracle Linux/Rocky Linux 9.

ActiveGate version 1.325 is **the last Synthetic-enabled** ActiveGate supported on Red Hat/Oracle Linux/Rocky Linux 8.

Additionally, with Dynatrace version 1.326, we plan to introduce mechanisms preventing Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates on Red Hat/Oracle Linux/Rocky Linux 8 from being updated beyond version 1.325.

Additional support notes

* Chromium development for Amazon Linux 2 stopped at version 126.
  For important security and stability reasons, we've decided to discontinue our support for installing Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate on Amazon Linux 2 after ActiveGate version 1.307.
  ActiveGate version 1.307 is the last Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate to support Amazon Linux 2.
  Additionally, with Dynatrace version 1.308, we have introduced mechanisms preventing Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates on Amazon Linux 2 from being updated beyond version 1.307.
* Chromium development for Red Hat/CentOS 7 stopped at version 126.
  For important security and stability reasons, we've decided to discontinue our support for installing Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate on Red Hat/CentOS 7 after ActiveGate version 1.305.
  ActiveGate version 1.305 is the last Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate to support Red Hat/CentOS 7.
  Additionally, with Dynatrace version 1.306, we have introduced mechanisms preventing Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates on Red Hat/CentOS 7 from being updated beyond version 1.305.

  + Since Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 reached [End of Maintenanceï»¿](https://dt-url.net/af03uea) support on June 30, 2024, all of its packages have been archived. This means that it may not be possible to find the required dependencies for update. For more details, see the [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 statusï»¿](https://dt-url.net/e623zr1)
* Check the latest [ActiveGate release notes](/docs/whats-new/activegate "Release notes for Dynatrace ActiveGate") for the oldest supported ActiveGate versions.

## Pros and cons of Linux and Windows operation systems

Both Linux and Windows operation systems have their pros and cons when deploying private Synthetic locations. Windows is relatively easy to deploy because the package includes all you need, whereas Linux is more convenient for smaller machinesâit's easier to manage, in particular when creating virtual machines.

## Operating system requirements

Antivirus and Anti-Malware software

Antivirus and anti-malware software can adversely affect Dynatrace Synthetic monitoring capabilities. The antivirus or anti-malware software might block the Chromium browser or Dynatrace processes responsible for executing synthetic monitors, cause Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate installation failures, interfere with network communication, and impact the reliability of measurements.

Please also note

To ensure proper stability and performance, consider adding the following directories and processes to the allowed list or excluding them from the policy:

**Directories:**

* All directories with `synthetic` in their path. For an overview of directories in use, see [ActiveGate directories](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/configuration/where-can-i-find-activegate-files#default-activegate-directories--windows "Find out where ActiveGate files are stored on Windows and Linux systems.").

**Processes:**

* chrome
* vucwrapper
* java

This is the minimal list of processes and directories required for Dynatrace Synthetic to operate. It's not guaranteed that the service will function correctly with only these exclusions. Collaborate with your vendor to appropriately allow expected behaviors from Dynatrace.

Prior to contacting Dynatrace support to troubleshoot issues with your private synthetic locations, make sure that antivirus or anti-malware software was excluded as a source of problems.

A freshly installed ActiveGate can run your private synthetic monitors (both HTTP and browser monitors) on the following operating systems.

### Windows

#### Supported operating systems

| Windows OS | Versions |
| --- | --- |
| Windows Server | 2016, 2019, 2022 |

#### Chromium version on Windows

2

ActiveGate version 1.307 is the last Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate to support Amazon Linux 2.

3

ActiveGate version 1.325 is the last Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate to support Red Hat/Oracle Linux/Rocky Linux 8.

#### Chromium versions on Linux

We strongly recommend that you keep your Linux-based Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates and Chromium versions updatedâDynatrace supports Chromium versions that are no more than two versions behind the latest Dynatrace-supported version for a specific ActiveGate release. For example, if the latest supported Chromium version is 103, Dynatrace supports up to Chromium version 101. If the provided Chromium version is significantly older for a specific OS, we support only the provided version. See information on updating Chromium [automatically](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations#chromium-autoupdate "Learn how to manage private locations in the Synthetic app.") and [manually](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/install-chromium-for-linux#chromium-manual "Learn how to install Chromium for Linux manually and from custom repositories.").

On Linux, the ActiveGate installer downloads the Chromium dependencies that are required by the Synthetic engine. On Red Hat and Rocky, you need to enable particular repositories from which the installer downloads the dependencies. The Dynatrace web UI provides you with all the required commands. For detailed instructions, see [Create a private synthetic location](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations#create-private-location "Learn how to manage private locations in the Synthetic app.").

When [installing ActiveGate and Chromium from a custom, local repository](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/install-chromium-for-linux#custom-repo "Learn how to install Chromium for Linux manually and from custom repositories."), you need to resolve all dependencies and enable repositories as required; the custom repository can be used only for Chromium packages, not their dependencies. Place the Chromium package archive and the signature file in the custom repository for installation. If your package archive file is `https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/Chromium/snap/chromium-107.0.5304.87-2168.tgz` (Chromium 107 for Ubuntu 20 and 22 on ActiveGate version 1.255), you can find the signature file by appending `.sig` to the URL: `https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/Chromium/snap/chromium-107.0.5304.87-2168.tgz.sig`.

* Chromium development for Red Hat/CentOS 7 and Amazon Linux 2 stopped at version 126.

  + Since Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 reached [End of Maintenanceï»¿](https://dt-url.net/af03uea) support on June 30, 2024, all of its packages have been archived. This means that it may not be possible to find the required dependencies for update. For more details, see the [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 statusï»¿](https://dt-url.net/e623zr1)

Due to changes in `libdav1d.so.6` packet availability Chromium versions older than 130 cannot be installed on Red Hat/Rocky Linux 9.
Please refer to [troubleshooting guideï»¿](https://dt-url.net/x303x5f) for details.

Introduced support for Oracle Linux 9.

#### File Access Policy Daemon framework (`fapolicyd`)

If not configured correctly, the File Access Policy Daemon (`fapolicyd`) can potentially affect Dynatrace Synthetic monitoring capabilities. Similarly to antivirus or anti-malware software, `fapolicyd` might block the Chromium browser or Dynatrace processes responsible for executing synthetic monitors.

To ensure proper stability and performance, consider adding directories and processes to the allowed list or excluding them from the policy. For more detailed information, refer to the [Red Hat documentation on fapolicydï»¿](https://dt-url.net/tn1v0z1x). Prior to contacting Dynatrace support to troubleshoot issues with your private synthetic locations, make sure that `fapolicyd` was excluded as a source of problems.

File Access Policy Daemon framework can be run in debug mode where all denials are logged, making tracking down missing rules and troubleshooting issues easier. For more detailed information about its debug mode, refer to the [documentation on troubleshooting problems related to fapolicydï»¿](https://dt-url.net/e943wcc)

## Hardware requirements

### General considerations

* Note that a Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate has more demanding hardware and system requirements than a regular Environment or Cluster ActiveGate. We strongly recommend using a Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate exclusively for synthetic monitoring purposes.
* Any additional component running on the host should be taken into account when planning resources provisioning. For instance, if the location is monitored by [OneAgent](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-oneagent/oa-requirements "OneAgent code module requirements") or another deep monitoring solution, memory (RAM) requirements will increase.
* You need to uninstall and reinstall your Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate to change its size, for example, after increasing the resources of your S-sized ActiveGate to meet the requirements for a size M. Reinstallation is required before you can make use of the updated resources for synthetic monitoring; otherwise, your ActiveGate will continue to show up as size S (**Synthetic Node size**) in **Deployment Status** and will be subject to the execution limits of size S.

### Sizing guide

Based on the number of tests executed per hour, Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates need to meet the following hardware requirements.

Limit values

The estimated limits listed in the table below were determined in our internal tests. The actual values might vary depending on the complexity of your monitors.

XS node

S node

M node

L node

XS node

While XS nodes can be used on Windows Server-based ActiveGates, they may not be the best fit due to the higher hardware demands of Chromium. For optimal performance and to prepare for future enhancements, we recommend having at least 8 GB of RAM and 25 GB of free disk space.

On Linux systems with only 4 GB of RAM, the increasing resource requirements of Chrome (or Chromium), combined with the installation of third-party tools on the host, may lead to occasional memory shortages. Upgrading to 8 GB of RAM is strongly recommended to help ensure a smoother and more reliable experience.

|  | Node with browser monitor support | Browserless node |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Minimum CPUs | 2 vCPU | 1 vCPU |
| Minimum free disk space | 20 GB | 17 GB |
| Minimum RAM | 4 GB | 4 GB |
| Minimum free RAM | 3 GB | 2,7 GB |
| Minimum disk IOPS (Windows) | 100 | 100 |
| Estimated maximum number of HTTP monitor executions/h[1](#fn-4-1-def) | 300k | 300k |
| Estimated maximum number of high-resource HTTP monitor[2](#fn-4-2-def) executions/h | 10k | 10k |
| Estimated maximum number of browser monitor executions/h | 300 | - |
| Estimated maximum number of NAM ICMP monitor packets/h[3](#fn-4-3-def) [5](#fn-4-5-def) | 500k | 500k |
| Estimated maximum number of NAM TCP monitor requests/h[4](#fn-4-4-def) [6](#fn-4-6-def) | 1M | 1M |
| Estimated maximum number of NAM DNS monitor request/h[4](#fn-4-4-def) [7](#fn-4-7-def) | 100k | 100k |

Footnotes

1

Calculated as 5000 monitor executions (maximum for a single environment) run once every minute (maximum frequency).

2

These are HTTP monitors on private locations with any of: pre- or post-execution scripts, OAuth2 authorization, Kerberos authentication.

3

For NAM monitors using ICMP request type, capacity is related to number of ICMP echo requests (packets) that are being sent during monitors execution. As this number of packets-to-be-sent may significantly vary among defined monitors, using the number of monitor executions as a capacity limit would be inaccurate.

4

For NAM monitors using TCP and DNS request types, capacity is related to the number of network connections (requests) that are being sent during monitors execution. As this number of requests may significantly vary among defined monitors, using the number of monitor executions as a capacity limit would be inaccurate.

5

During load tests that helped to establish capacity limits, NAM ICMP monitors were exclusively scheduled on location; monitors had the following characteristic. Actual capacity may be different for other environments (for example, those where monitored targets respond slower or are failing to provide a response within timeout limit or other type of monitors are executed at the same time).
Monitors were using default settings (including default timeouts settings and single packet per-request) and were scheduled every 1 minute.
There were multiple target hosts used during tests; all of them were responding properly with average RTT around 200ms.

6

During load tests that helped to establish capacity limits, NAM TCP monitors were exclusively scheduled on location; monitors had the following characteristic. Actual capacity may be different for other environments (for example, those where monitored targets respond slower or are failing to provide a response within timeout limit or other type of monitors are executed at the same time).
Monitors were using default settings (including default timeouts settings) and were scheduled every 1 minute.
There were multiple target hosts and ports used during tests; all of them were responding properly with average TCP connection time around 200ms.

7

During load tests that helped to establish capacity limits, NAM DNS monitors were exclusively scheduled on location; monitors had the following characteristic. Actual capacity may be different for other environments (for example, those where monitored targets respond slower or are failing to provide a response within timeout limit or other type of monitors are executed at the same time). Please note that DNS server used during resolution should be able to handle incoming requests and may not consider the incoming traffic as a subject to throttling or rejection (for example, due to detection as bot-originated).
Monitors were using default settings (including default timeouts settings and UDP as a transport) and were scheduled every 1 minute.
There were multiple resolution targets used during tests; all of them were resolved properly with average DNS resolution time around 10ms.
Publicly available DNS servers were used: Google (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) and Cloudflare (1.1.1.1 and 1.1.1.2)

For NAM monitors using ICMP request type, capacity is related to number of ICMP echo requests (packets) that are being sent during monitors execution. As this number of packets-to-be-sent may significantly vary among defined monitors, using the number of monitor executions as a capacity limit would be inaccurate.

4

For NAM monitors using TCP and DNS request types, capacity is related to the number of network connections (requests) that are being sent during monitors execution. As this number of requests may significantly vary among defined monitors, using the number of monitor executions as a capacity limit would be inaccurate.

5

During load tests that helped to establish capacity limits, NAM ICMP monitors were exclusively scheduled on location; monitors had the following characteristic. Actual capacity may be different for other environments (for example, those where monitored targets respond slower or are failing to provide a response within timeout limit or other type of monitors are executed at the same time).
Monitors were using default settings (including default timeouts settings and single packet per-request) and were scheduled every 1 minute.
There were multiple target hosts used during tests; all of them were responding properly with average RTT around 200ms.

#### Permissions for `/tmp`

Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate requires write access to the `/tmp` directory during runtime. Its dependencies, including xvfb, utilize `/tmp` for storing temporary files and runtime data.
Lack of write permissions to this directory may result in unexpected failures or degraded functionality.
Ensure that the host environment provides sufficient access rights and available space in `/tmp` to support these operations reliably.

# Private synthetic locations

# Private synthetic locations

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* Updated on Dec 22, 2025

The goal of private locations is to execute synthetic monitors. You need to use private locations to monitor applications and endpoints within corporate networks, which are unavailable from the public internet. Also, private locations are obligatory for executing [NAM](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-a-nam-monitor-synthetic-app "Learn how to set up a NAM monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.") monitors.

With monitors executed from a private location, you can bring the testing capabilities available in public locations right into your own environment. With private locations you can:

* Measure internal webpage performance and availability.
* Measure complex internal applications with browser clickpaths.
* Measure external resources with synthetic monitors run from internal locations.
* Monitor APIs, both internal and external.

You can create only classic locations using ![Synthetic Classic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-512-83ec796e54.png "Synthetic Classic") **Synthetic**, although the locations list displays classic and containerized (for example, Kubernetes and OpenShift) locations. If you still need to create a containerized location, you can do it in [Settings Classic](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location#add "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring.").

The **Private locations** tab in ![Synthetic Classic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-512-83ec796e54.png "Synthetic Classic") **Synthetic** shows the list of all private locations available within a given environment. For each private location, there's information about how many synthetic monitors are assigned to it, with links to those monitors.

If you created a private location in previous Dynatrace, it remains available in latest Dynatraceâthere's no need to redeploy it.

## System and hardware requirements for private locations

Make sure the target host you plan to use for running synthetic monitors complies with [system and hardware requirements for private Synthetic locations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/requirements-for-private-synthetic "Check system and hardware requirements for private Synthetic locations."). Note that Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates have more demanding hardware and system requirements than a regular Environment or Cluster ActiveGate.

Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate installed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and 22.04 LTS only You can use [`TEMP`](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/installation/linux/linux-customize-installation-for-activegate#temporary "Learn about the command-line parameters that you can use with ActiveGate on Linux.") to customize the [default temporary directory for private Synthetic files](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/configuration/where-can-i-find-activegate-files#default-activegate-directories--linux "Find out where ActiveGate files are stored on Windows and Linux systems.")â`/var/tmp/dynatrace/synthetic`. However, the path must begin with `/var/tmp`, for example, `TEMP=/var/tmp/syn`. Dynatrace requires write access to `/var/tmp` for the installation of Chromium snap packages.

End-of-support information

There are no new versions of Chromium for Red Hat/Oracle Linux/Rocky Linux 8 beyond version 133. For important security and stability reasons, we've decided to discontinue our support for installing **Synthetic-enabled** ActiveGate on Red Hat/Oracle Linux/Rocky Linux 8 after ActiveGate version 1.325.

To ensure the continuity and security of your synthetic monitors, we recommend migrating your Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate to one of the [supported operating systems](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/system-and-hardware-requirements-for-private-synthetic#linux-supported-os "Supported operating systems, Chromium versions, and hardware requirements for running synthetic monitors from private locations"), for example, Red Hat/Oracle Linux/Rocky Linux 9.

ActiveGate version 1.325 is **the last Synthetic-enabled** ActiveGate supported on Red Hat/Oracle Linux/Rocky Linux 8.

Additionally, with Dynatrace version 1.326, we plan to introduce mechanisms preventing Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates on Red Hat/Oracle Linux/Rocky Linux 8 from being updated beyond version 1.325.

Additional support notes

* Chromium development for Amazon Linux 2 stopped at version 126.
  For important security and stability reasons, we've decided to discontinue our support for installing Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate on Amazon Linux 2 after ActiveGate version 1.307.
  ActiveGate version 1.307 is the last Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate to support Amazon Linux 2.
  Additionally, with Dynatrace version 1.308, we have introduced mechanisms preventing Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates on Amazon Linux 2 from being updated beyond version 1.307.
* Chromium development for Red Hat/CentOS 7 stopped at version 126.
  For important security and stability reasons, we've decided to discontinue our support for installing Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate on Red Hat/CentOS 7 after ActiveGate version 1.305.
  ActiveGate version 1.305 is the last Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate to support Red Hat/CentOS 7.
  Additionally, with Dynatrace version 1.306, we have introduced mechanisms preventing Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates on Red Hat/CentOS 7 from being updated beyond version 1.305.

  + Since Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 reached [End of Maintenanceï»¿](https://dt-url.net/af03uea) support on June 30, 2024, all of its packages have been archived. This means that it may not be possible to find the required dependencies for update. For more details, see the [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 statusï»¿](https://dt-url.net/e623zr1)
* Check the latest [ActiveGate release notes](/docs/whats-new/activegate "Release notes for Dynatrace ActiveGate") for the oldest supported ActiveGate versions.

### Before you begin

* You cannot execute synthetic monitors using an Environment ActiveGate configured for [multi-environment support](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/configuration/configure-an-environment-activegate-for-multi-environment-support "Read the step-by-step procedure for configuring a single Environment ActiveGate for multi-environment support.").
* You can create a private location using a clean-installed Synthetic-enabled Environment ActiveGate version 1.169+ or Cluster ActiveGate with Dynatrace Managed version 1.176+. If you want to use an existing ActiveGate host, [uninstall ActiveGate](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/operation/uninstall-activegate "Learn how to remove ActiveGate from Windows or Linux-based systems.") first.
* Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate is used exclusively to run synthetic monitors. A clean ActiveGate installation for the purpose of synthetic monitoring disables all other ActiveGate features, including communication with OneAgents.

* Only IPv4 and DNS UDP are supported for network configuration.

* Both manual and automatic Chromium updates require access to `https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com`. For security reasons, public access to the S3 bucket is enabled only for specific files; trying anything else will result in a 403 error.

## Create a private location

To add a classic private location

1. Go to the **Private locations** tab in the upper-left corner of the ![Synthetic Classic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-512-83ec796e54.png "Synthetic Classic") **Synthetic** home page.
2. Select  **New private locations**  > **Classic**.
3. Name your location.
4. Map it from an existing geographic location or add a custom location defined by **Country**, **Region**, **City**, **Latitude**, and **Longitude**.
5. Select **Existing ActiveGate** to add an existing Synthetic-enabled Activegate to the location or **Deploy new ActiveGate** to deploy a new one (deploying a new ActiveGate will redirect you to [![Discovery & Coverage](https://dt-cdn.net/images/discovery-coverage-256-a20d5afa78.png "Discovery & Coverage") **Discovery & Coverage**](/docs/ingest-from/discovery-coverage-app "Discover and remediate monitoring coverage gaps at scale.") from where you can [install an ActiveGate](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/active-gate-for-private-locations-install "Learn how to install Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates.")).

   Add multiple ActiveGates if you plan to run a large number of synthetic monitors.
   Additional ActiveGates are used for failover and load balancing.

   * We recommend using at least two ActiveGates for a location.
   * You can't use one ActiveGate for multiple locations.

6. Optional Turn on **Enable Chromium auto-update**âit will be triggered during the Synthetic engine updates at this location.

   You can **Enable Chromium auto-update** at the location level, that is, for all ActiveGates assigned to a private location. Chromium autoupdate takes place during manual as well as automatic ActiveGate and Synthetic engine updates.

   As we recommend using the [latest supported Chromium version](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/requirements-for-private-synthetic#chromium-linux "Check system and hardware requirements for private Synthetic locations.") for the smooth and secure execution of browser monitors from your private location, Chromium autoupdate is turned on by default for locations with Linux-based ActiveGates. If you don't want Chromium to be updated automatically, for example, to use a specific version of Chromium, or if you have offline environments, turn off the switch **before triggering an ActiveGate update**.

   This setting only applies to Linux-based ActiveGates; on Windows-based ActiveGates, Chromium is always updated during Synthetic engine updates. If your location has only Windows-based ActiveGates, the toggle is turned on but grayed out.

   Successful Chromium autoupdate requires access to OS (system) repositories for Chromium dependencies and access to `https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com` for Chromium components. If you've enabled a [custom local repository](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/install-chromium-for-linux#custom-repo "Learn how to install Chromium for Linux manually and from custom repositories."), Chromium components (but not dependencies) need to be available at the specified HTTP server address. See [Chromium autoupdate from a custom repository](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/install-chromium-for-linux#autoupdate-custom-repo "Learn how to install Chromium for Linux manually and from custom repositories.").

   You will see a message if Chromium autoupdate fails for this or other reasonsâwe recommend either meeting the requirements for autoupdate (such as access to repositories) or disabling Chromium autoupdate for your private location.

   * We strongly recommend that you keep your Linux-based Synthetic-enabled ActiveGates and Chromium versions updatedâDynatrace supports Chromium versions that are no more than two versions behind the [latest Dynatrace-supported version](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/requirements-for-private-synthetic#chromium-linux "Check system and hardware requirements for private Synthetic locations.") for a specific ActiveGate release. If you don't opt for Chromium autoupdate, you can [update Chromium manually](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/install-chromium-for-linux#chromium-manual "Learn how to install Chromium for Linux manually and from custom repositories.").
   * If you disable Chromium autoupdate, you can [manually update Chromium](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/install-chromium-for-linux#chromium-manual "Learn how to install Chromium for Linux manually and from custom repositories.") per ActiveGate. However, Chromium autoupdate is required when using [custom repositories](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/install-chromium-for-linux#custom-repo "Learn how to install Chromium for Linux manually and from custom repositories."). See [Chromium autoupdate from a custom repository](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/install-chromium-for-linux#autoupdate-custom-repo "Learn how to install Chromium for Linux manually and from custom repositories.").
   * Autoupdate works to update Chromium to the latest version that Dynatrace provides for an ActiveGate release. In some cases, this might be different from the [latest Dynatrace-supported Chromium version](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/requirements-for-private-synthetic#chromium-linux "Check system and hardware requirements for private Synthetic locations.") for the ActiveGate release.

   Also, check our information on [installing Chromium and other dependencies manually (Linux only)](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/install-chromium-for-linux#manual "Learn how to install Chromium for Linux manually and from custom repositories.").
7. Optional If you have outage issues with your private location, use the **Location outage handling** options to receive related notifications. See the on-screen instructions for details.

   * You can configure the location to generate a problem when the entire private location is unavailable (all ActiveGates are offline), or if the location lacks the capability required for the monitor type to be executed.
   * You can configure the location to generate a problem when a single ActiveGate at this location is offline.

   For example, suppose your location has two ActiveGates, and you enable both problem switches. You will see three problems when your location is unavailableâone for the entire location and one for each ActiveGate that's offline.

   Containerized locations

   For containerized locations, you can only generate a problem when the entire private location is unavailable (all ActiveGates are offline), or if the location lacks the capability required for the monitor type to be executed.
8. Select **Save**.

## Additional deployment modes

Additional deployment modes available to you

* Browserless
* Kerberos
* FIPS compliant

### Browserless Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate

In general, we recommend the deployment of Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate to support the execution of all types synthetic monitors (HTTP, browser, NAM).

If you don't need to execute browser monitors, however, you might want to consider deploying your node in a special browserless mode. Such a node will be deployed without the browser. The resulting deployment requires less hardware resources, but browser monitors cannot be executed from such a node.

Consider browserless nodes as an alternative to nodes with browser monitor support when you're focused purely on:

* Network and infrastructure use cases (using NAM monitors)
* API monitoring (using HTTP monitors)

### Kerberos client setup

If you want to run browser monitors using Kerberos authentication, the private location should be configured to be able to get ticket from the Kerberos Key Distribution Center.

Windows

Linux

1. Each Windows machine using Kerberos has to be properly configured with Active Directory.
2. If you are unable to authenticate with Kerberos on Windows, use the following command to register the machine.

```
ksetup /addkdc DOMAIN.TO.ADD address.of.kerberos.server
```

The `DOMAIN.TO.ADD` is your domain name and `address.of.kerberos.server` is the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (Active Directory Controller if you're using a Microsoft solution). Note that in the credentials used, the domain name must be in uppercase (for example, user@EXAMPLE.COM).

Synthetic uses Kerberos authentication by executing the `kinit` command. For details, see [MIT Kerberos Documentation - kinitï»¿](https://dt-url.net/pr43wj6).

A Linux private location has to be properly configured to be able to get a ticket from the Kerberos Key Distribution Center. Make sure that the location has the following:

* Installed packages for Kerberos client (workstation).
* Properly configured `/etc/krb5.conf` file (or configuration file specified by `KRB5_CONFIG` environment variable).

The configuration is dependent on the Linux distribution. You can find more information in the official documentation.

* Ubuntu:

  + `sudo apt install krb5-user`
  + More information: [Ubuntu Server Documentation - How to set up basic workstation authenticationï»¿](https://dt-url.net/3g03w9p)
* Red Hat/Rocky:

  + `yum install krb5-workstation krb5-libs`
  + More information: [Red Hat Documentation - Configuring a Kerberos Clientï»¿](https://dt-url.net/1u23wq7)

### Synthetic FIPS compliance

ActiveGate version 1.315+

#### Installation

To install Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate in FIPS compliant mode, you need to add the `--fips-mode` flag. See also [customize ActiveGate installation for FIPS compliance](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/installation/linux/linux-customize-installation-for-activegate#fips-compliant-mode "Learn about the command-line parameters that you can use with ActiveGate on Linux.").

```
/bin/bash ./Dynatrace-ActiveGate-Linux.sh --enable-synthetic --fips-mode
```

Please note that FIPS-compliant mode cannot be changed after installation. To change the mode, you need to uninstall ActiveGate and reinstall it with the desired settings.
Additionally, if you intend to execute browser monitors, additional setup will be required as described in [Proxy configuration for FIPS mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/proxy-for-private-locations#fips-proxy "Learn how to manage proxies for private Synthetic locations.") and [Proxy configuration for FIPS mode with corporate proxy](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations/proxy-for-private-locations#fips-corporate-proxy "Learn how to manage proxies for private Synthetic locations.").

#### Requirements and limitations

* We require operating system with FIPS-compliant mode enabled, see also [ActiveGate FIPS compliance](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/activegate-fips-compliance "Learn about ActiveGate FIPS compliance").
* Following operating systems are currently supported:

  + Ubuntu Pro 22.04
  + Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9
* Private Synthetic locations on Kubernetes are not supported at the moment.

#### Ensuring compliance

To ensure the browser monitor traffic is FIPS compliant, it must be routed through a local intercepting proxy that encrypts traffic with a FIPS-certified crypto library. See [Proxy configuration for FIPS mode](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/private-locations#fips-proxy "Learn how to manage private locations in the Synthetic app.") for details.

For HTTP monitors, we use the [Amazon Corretto Crypto Providerï»¿](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider/) FIPS-certified cryptographic library that uses AWS-LC-FIPS 2.x as its cryptographic module. See [Certificate #4816ï»¿](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/4816).

Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate in FIPS compliant mode supports the same set of cipher suites as [regular ActiveGate](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-activegate/activegate-fips-compliance#supported-cipher-suites "Learn about ActiveGate FIPS compliance").

Each `tgz` package archive is stored in the S3 bucket together with the `*.tgz.sig` signature file. To verify if the packages on your drive are authentic Dynatrace-provided archives:

1. Download the signature file. The filename is identical to the package archive but has the `sig` filename extension. For example, for Chromium 140, the command is:

   ```
   curl --output chromium.tgz.sig https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/Chromium/rpm/chromium-140.0.7339.185-1.el9.tgz.sig
   ```
2. Verify the package:

   ```
   wget https://ca.dynatrace.com/dt-root.cert.pem ; openssl cms



   -verify



   -in chromium.tgz.sig



   -inform PEM



   -content chromium.tgz



   -binary



   -CAfile dt-root.cert.pem > /dev/null
   ```
3. Verify the signature timestamp.

   You can also get the exact timestamp of a signature. Download the `*.tgz.sig.tsr` file from the same location as the installation packages and signature, and then run the following command:

   ```
   openssl ts -reply -in chromium.tgz.sig.tsr -text
   ```

Each `zip` package archive is stored in the S3 bucket together with the `*.zip.sig` signature file. To verify if the packages on your drive are authentic Dynatrace-provided archives:

1. Download the signature file. The filename is identical to the package archive but has the `sig` filename extension. For example, for Chrome for Testing 141.0.7390.122, the command is:

   ```
   curl --output chrome.zip.sig https://synthetic-packages.s3.amazonaws.com/Chrome/chrome-for-testing-linux64/chrome-for-testing-linux64-141.0.7390.122.zip.sig
   ```
2. Verify the package:

   ```
   wget https://ca.dynatrace.com/dt-root.cert.pem ; openssl cms



   -verify



   -in chrome.zip.sig



   -inform PEM



   -content chrome.zip



   -binary



   -CAfile dt-root.cert.pem > /dev/null
   ```
3. Verify the signature timestamp.

   You can also get the exact timestamp of a signature. Download the `*.zip.sig.tsr` file from the same location as installation packages and signature and run the following command:

   ```
   openssl ts -reply -in chrome.zip.sig.tsr -text
   ```

Can I use a proxy with the Synthetic-enabled ActiveGate?

With ActiveGate version 1.175+, an ActiveGate executing synthetic monitors can connect through the proxy to both the Dynatrace Cluster and the tested resource. For more information, see [Setting up proxy for private synthetic monitoring](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/setting-up-proxy-for-private-synthetic "Learn how to configure ActiveGate properties to set up a proxy for private synthetic monitoring.").

Can I update an earlier ActiveGate to version 1.169+ and configure it to use with private synthetic monitors?

No, you need to run a clean installation specifically for the purpose of synthetic monitoring to enable your ActiveGate to execute monitors from private locations.

Can I turn on Synthetic on an existing ActiveGate installation?

Private Synthetic locations require a clean installation of ActiveGate specifically for the purpose of synthetic monitoring.

Manually editing the `custom.properties` file is not enough to enable the ActiveGate to execute synthetic monitors.

# HTTP monitors reporting results

# HTTP monitors reporting results

* Latest Dynatrace
* Reference
* 15-min read
* Updated on Nov 03, 2025

The HTTP monitors reporting results page provides an overview panel of monitor execution results, result visualizations, and monitor properties. The details panel shows you at-a-glance information and graphs, with ready links and filters to drill right down to problem details and edit monitor settings.

To access the HTTP monitors reporting results page,

1. Go to ![Synthetic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-new-256-1ddb35ac79.png "Synthetic") **Synthetic**.
2. Optional Select **HTTP** on the left to filter the list for HTTP monitors.
3. From the list of HTTP monitors, select the monitor you want to examine.
4. Select **View details** from the preview panel to access the details page.

![HTTP Monitor Reporting - Top](https://dt-cdn.net/images/screenshot-2025-06-11-112148-3221-e023915f0e.png)

![HTTP Monitor Reporting - Bottom](https://dt-cdn.net/images/screenshot-2025-06-11-112555-3221-cedecd8ab7.png)

## Metric visualizations

The top panel shows overall monitor [availability](#availability) and [performance](#performance) infographics for the selected timeframe.

Use the  filter bar at the top of the page to filter all HTTP details by one or more locations.

In the upper-right corner of the page, you can access [**Analyze executions**](#analyze-executions), [**On-demand execution**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/on-demand-executions "Learn about how to perform on-demand executions."), and more HTTP monitor settings:

* **Edit**
* for more options ( **Disable** and  **Delete**)

### Analyze executions

DPS License

If you're a non-DPS user, see [HTTP monitors reporting results](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/synthetic-details-for-http-monitors-classic#analyze-last-execution "Learn about the Synthetic details page for HTTP monitors.").

When you access **Analyze executions** functionality, you're presented with the **Select execution** section with the scatter plot chart on which you can move the view window to the next or previous 50 executions. For readability, the whole chart is limited to 100 points. The content of the scatter plot chart might be divided into results (success/failure), locations, or all of those dimensions. Therefore, you can analyze your executions in three ways:

* **Split by status**âthe default view shows **Healthy** and **Failed** executions separately. Below the graph, there's a legend where you can select any status to focus the graph on it. Select  icon for more options.
* **Split by location**âshows executions performed from different locations. Below the graph, there's a legend where you can select a given location to focus the graph on it. Select  icon for more options.
* **Split by both**âcombines the **Split by status** and **Split by location** views.

  Note that if there's more than one execution status for the location, the legend below the graph presents the location more than once. For example, `Las Vegas (Healthy)` and `Las Vegas (Failed)`.

Not only can you see the details of the last failed or successful execution, but also the details of all executions within the retention period.

![Analyze executions view](https://dt-cdn.net/images/analyze-executions-3022-c395fceee3.png)

* Each dot represents a separate execution. You can select any dot, hover over the data, and select **Analyze execution** to display the execution's details in the panel below.
* You can narrow down the displayed details to a needed set of elements using filters visible on the left in the **Visible parts** section.
* You can also select two executions for comparison. To do that

  1. Select an execution and hover over their data visible in the tooltip. Then, select **Analyze execution**.
  2. Select the second execution you want to compare the first with. Hover over their data visible in the tooltip and select **Compare execution**.

  You'll see the following comparison:

  ![Synthetic HTTP compare execution](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-http-responses-comparison-1914-2d38bd9eac.png)

On-demand executions

You can trigger an execution on-demand. For details, see [On-demand monitor executions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/on-demand-executions "Learn about how to perform on-demand executions.").

## Availability

The Availability section displays the monitor's availability for the selected timeframe, with details of downtime and affected locations, if any. The panel contains information about all problems related to the given monitor. Outage (downtime) duration and affected locations infographics are displayed if the monitor is down (unavailable) at one or more locations.

Also, the panel shows reasons for discarded tests. The bar above the time frame indicates when a downtime occurred. Hover over the bar to see why the tests were discarded. The possible reasons can be:

* **Maintenance window** - the monitor execution was deliberately [made inactive](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/notifications-and-alerting/maintenance-windows/define-maintenance-window#disable-synthetic "Create maintenance windows and define their scope.") due to maintenance. For details, see the maintenance window.

  How to see the maintenance window, and what happens if the monitor execution is on/off

  To see the maintenance window:

  1. Select the bar to pin the **Maintenance window** tooltip.
  2. Hover over the **Maintenance window** tooltip.
  3. Select **View maintenance window settings**.
  4. Select **Settings Classic**.

  + When the **Disable synthetic monitor execution** option is on in the maintenance window, the tests are suppressed during the maintenance period so there are no tests results for this period.
  + When the **Disable synthetic monitor execution** option is on in the maintenance window, the scheduled automatic tests are suppressed during the maintenance period, but the [on-demand](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/on-demand-executions "Execute synthetic monitors on demand from public or private locations") tests are not suppressed.
  + When the **Disable synthetic monitor execution** option is off in the maintenance window, the tests are executed during the maintenance period, but, due to maintenance, the test results may differ from those observed under the normal conditions.

* **No result** - the execution started but the results were not delivered. Reach out to the Dynatrace support team.
* **No capability** - you're trying to execute monitors that aren't supported by a location (for example, NAM ICMP monitors - from a location with inactive ICMP).
* **Discarded, not executed** - the probable cause is the overloaded private location. Check the capacity metrics. If there are no issues with the metrics, contact the Dynatrace support team.
* **Http monitor local outage** - the outage happened in one or more locations from which the monitor executed the tests.
* **Http monitor global outage** - the outage happened in all locations from which the monitor executed the tests.

  Local and global outage - view problem details

  To see the details of the problem that's causing the local or global outage:

  1. Select the bar with the  icon to pin the **Http monitor local outage** or **Http monitor global outage** tooltip.
  2. Hover over the tooltip.
  3. Select  **View problem details**.
  4. Select one of the available options:

     + **Problems Classic**
     + **Problems** in the problems app
     + **Problems** in the current app to view problem details.

A monitor can be down at one or all locations even if no [outage thresholds (global or local)](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-and-configure-an-http-monitor#outage-and-performance "Learn how to set up and edit an HTTP monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.") have been set up. The outage duration is the sum of all downtimes in the selected timeframe, not counting overlapping downtimes.

The **Availability** card shows overall availability across all monitor locations, with annotations for global/local outages and global/local missing data (as when the monitor is inactive).

### Availability calculation

Availability metrics are calculated by dividing the number of successful executions ("up") by the total number of executions. Thus, to calculate availability

1. Determine the number of up executions within the timeframe.

   This is the total number of executions within the timeframe, minus the number of failed ("down") executions within the timeframe.
2. Determine availability.

   Divide the number of up executions by the total number of executions, and then multiply by 100 to get a percentage.

**Example**

Suppose we have 5 down executions within a 35-minute timeframe.

* Total executions = `35`
* Down executions = `5`
* Up executions = `35-5 = 30`
* Availability = `(30/35) \* 100 = 0.8571 \* 100` = `85.71 percent`

#### Exclude maintenance period executions from metrics calculations

You can set up a [maintenance window](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/notifications-and-alerting/maintenance-windows "Understand when to use a maintenance window. Read about the supported maintenance window types.") so [test executions are not suppressed](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/notifications-and-alerting/maintenance-windows/define-maintenance-window#disable-synthetic "Create maintenance windows and define their scope.") during maintenance periods. Then, if outages happen during the maintenance period, down executions are included in the metrics calculations.

In the example below, the availability is less than 100% because the down executions are included in the metric calculation by default.

```
timeseries avg(dt.synthetic.http.availability), by:{dt.entity.http_check, dt.maintenance_window_ids, interpolated}



| filter dt.entity.http_check == "HTTP_CHECK-2F280898D4FCB1A8"
```

Run in Playground

![Availability with included maintenance period executions](https://dt-cdn.net/images/a40863a4-4a5d-4380-8ef8-7d8353639756-1179-34988a102e.png)

To exclude the maintenance period executions from the metric calculation

1. Add the `dt.maintenance_window_ids` dimension to the query.
2. Filter the executions that are not covered by the maintenance window with `isNull(dt.maintenance_window_ids)`.

In the example below, we have down executions detected during the maintenance period, but they were not included into the calculation metric due to we used the `dt.maintenance_window_ids` dimension, and the `isNull(dt.maintenance_window_ids)` filter condition.

```
timeseries av = avg(dt.synthetic.http.availability), by: {dt.entity.http_check, dt.maintenance_window_ids}



| filter dt.entity.http_check == "HTTP_CHECK-2F280898D4FCB1A8"



| filter isNull(dt.maintenance_window_ids)



| fields avgAV=arrayAvg(av)
```

Run in Playground

![Example use of dt.maintenance_window_ids](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dem-3738-1179-248a06b401.png)

#### Interpolation

The approach described above requires all executions to happen at the same rate. However, in a real-world environment this is not always the case as the monitor execution frequency may change or additional on-demand executions may be triggered.

To make the calculation more accurate, the interpolation mechanism is introduced: the total monitoring time is divided into minute-level data points. All data points count as executions, although they don't necessarily coincide with actual executions.

On the screen below, the blue data points coincide with actual executions, and the white data points don't.

![Up/down interpolated data points](https://dt-cdn.net/images/screenshot-2025-06-05-142009-1552-ea3432b75b.png)

Let's imagine a monitor is set to execute tests every five minutes. So, every fifth data point (blue) coincides with an actual execution. All data points following the first down execution and preceding the first up execution count as "down." Thus, when calculating the availability metrics, the number of down executions is calculated as follows:

Down executions = the first actual down execution + all following "down" data points.

### Open in Notebooks

DPS License

Through the Availability section, you can also access **Notebooks** ![Notebooks](https://dt-cdn.net/images/notebooks-768-046137830a.webp "Notebooks") with three predefined DQL queries which are executed to get data from Synthetic events in Grail.

Note that queries for synthetic events from outside the Synthetic application, such as those from **Notebooks** ![Notebooks](https://dt-cdn.net/images/notebooks-768-046137830a.webp "Notebooks"), **Dashboards** ![Dashboards](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-512-b1f1e9690b.png "Dashboards"), and **SRG** ![Site Reliability Guardian](https://dt-cdn.net/images/site-reliability-guardian-ec19b393a6.svg "Site Reliability Guardian"), are **not** charged.

The predefined queries are examples of how to deal with synthetic monitor execution details using our Dynatrace Query Language. You can use those queries as patterns and adjust them to your needs.

* Query number 1âreturns an executions list of the selected monitors within the selected time range. For each execution, the query returns a timestamp, basic information about the result, and an ID.
* Query number 2âby default contains the filter applied to the last execution from the list mentioned above and returns details of each executed step of the monitor.
* Query number 3âreturns full details of an HTTP monitor execution, including the whole request and response.

## Performance

The performance section displays the HTTP monitor's performanceâresponse time for the sum of all requests across all locations for the selected timeframe. We don't do sum operation for executions from different locations.

Additional metrics are captured per request and are shown in the [requests card](#http-requests).

**Performance** card shows trend lines for response time for the execution time for the whole monitor with the shaded area representing the difference between the two values at any given time. Note that if your monitor runs from a single location, the minimum and maximum trend lines coincide.

Optional You can view trend lines for the HTTP monitor's performance.

### Display problems in Performance section

* Red bar above the chart indicates an ongoing problem.
* Grey bar above the chart indicates a closed problem.

Availability and other problems are not marked in this section.

If the monitor violates a [performance threshold](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-and-configure-an-http-monitor#outage-and-performance "Learn how to set up and edit an HTTP monitor to check the performance and availability of your site."), whether for the sum of all requests or an individual request, a solid red line appears above the performance graph for the problem duration. Select the solid red bar to display a link to the problem overview page.

View problem details

1. Hover over the problem bar to see an ongoing/closed problem details in the form of a tooltip.
2. Select the problem bar and hover over the tooltip to display more options.
3. Select  **View problem details** to open the problem details in Problems ![Problems app - new](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dynatrace-davis-new-256-340162f8c6.webp "Problems app - new").

## Problems

The **Problems** card shows performance (threshold violation) and availability (local or global outage) problems when you enable the respective thresholds in [monitor settings](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-and-configure-an-http-monitor#outage-and-performance "Learn how to set up and edit an HTTP monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.").

See [Create and configure an HTTP monitor](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-and-configure-an-http-monitor "Learn how to set up and edit an HTTP monitor to check the performance and availability of your site.") for information on defining performance and thresholds availability outage rules. See the [Synthetic alerting overview](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/analysis-and-alerting/synthetic-alerting-overview "Learn about synthetic alerting concepts and workflow.") for alerting workflow and concepts, including setting up notification profiles and templates.

There are three main problem types for HTTP monitors:

* Global outage (availability)
* Local outage (availability)
* Performance threshold violation (performance problem for sum of all requests or individual requests)

Performance problems may combine threshold violations at the monitor as well as request levels.

The problems section lists all problems in the selected time frame, both open and closed. On top of that, you can:

* See the details of a problem in the form of a table with a start date and duration.
* Expand each problem to see affected entities and alerting profiles.

Problems, along with their constituent [events](#events) and any corresponding [status codes](#http-requests) give you a full picture of the number and scope of your monitor's issues.

## HTTP requests

An HTTP monitor can consist of one or multiple HTTP requests. The **HTTP requests** card overviews all executed requests, their order, name, request URL, and the HTTP method used. For each request, the **HTTP requests** card splits performance (**Response time**) by the following metrics (see more in [HTTP monitor metrics](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/http-monitor-metrics-classic "Learn about the performance metrics collected for HTTP monitors.")):

* **DNS lookup time**
* **TCP connect time**
* **TLS handshake time**
* **Waiting**
* **Download**

**Response time** is the summation of these different metrics.

Expand a request from the list to view all performance metrics in one chart. Select a metric in the legend to remove/add it to the performance chart. Select **Edit request** to go to monitor settings from this card.

The **Status codes** tab shows the timeline of returned HTTP status codes for a particular request. (The [HTTP status codes card](#status-codes) shows the returned HTTP status codes for your HTTP monitor as a whole.)

When a request violates its [event-specific performance threshold](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app/create-and-configure-an-http-monitor#outage-and-performance "Learn how to set up and edit an HTTP monitor to check the performance and availability of your site."), it is highlighted in red. Expand the request to see the performance timings and the threshold violated. A solid red line for the problem duration appears above the stacked graph; the request threshold appears as a dotted red line. Select the solid red bar to display a link to the problem overview page.

## Errors

The **Errors** card displays errors found in the selected time frame.

The Problems section lists all problems, both open and closed. On top of that, you can:

* See the details of an error in the form of a table with the request and number of occurrences.
* Select **Analyze errors**  for an in-depth error analysis.

## Response size

The **Response size** card shows trend lines for minimum and maximum response size for the sum of all requests, with any shaded area representing the difference between the two values at any given time. The trend lines might coincide, as when your monitor runs from a single location. However, response size might vary, for example, when different responses are sent based on location.

To track such differences, you can **Show response size breakdown per location**. Note that if you filter the entire details page by any locations, the toggle is no longer available.

## Events

The **Events** card shows all events that compose problems. Events for active as well as resolved problems show up in the list and timeline.

Hover over a time slot in the event timeline to see the type and number of events generated at that interval. Select a time slot to view a tooltip with the events that took place in it.

Select an event type, for example, **HTTP monitor location slowdown**, to see the list of events. One slowdown event is always created per location where your monitor violates request- or monitor-level performance thresholds. Select an individual event to see details.

The [`api.fail()` method](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/http-monitors-classic/pre-and-post-scripting-for-http-monitors-classic#end "Learn how to apply pre and post scripts to your requests") can be used to define a custom **Failure message** that appears in the Events card in case of failure. Custom log messages also appear in the `customLogs` attribute in [HTTP monitor execution details](#analyze-last-execution).

## Properties and tags

This informational card shows the number of steps, locations, frequency of monitor execution, and any applied tags.

Select  **Edit** to edit or apply additional tags.

## Changes

The **Changes** card shows the history log that displays:

* When the monitor was created and who created it.
* Who changed the monitor properties, when the change was made, and which properties were changed in the selected timeframe.

## Frontends

The **Frontends** card displays the frontends to which the monitor is assigned.

## Services

The **Services** card displays any monitored services automatically associated with the HTTP monitor. This card appears when the monitored HTTP endpoint is hosted on a OneAgent-monitored host, and the endpoint URL is handled by one of the discovered services. The association between the HTTP monitor and the service is made based on data provided by OneAgent. Therefore, at least one monitor execution needs to be completed before a service can be associated with the monitor.

Select the link for a displayed service to view the service overview page, filtered by the HTTP monitor.

### View traces

In HTTP monitors that have associated services, you can see:

* A full list of traces for an entire monitor within a specific period of time
* A full list of traces for a specific service within a specific period of time
* Traces for specific synthetic executions

#### Traces for an entire monitor

To see a full list of traces for an entire monitor, select **View traces** in either of these locations:

* The top of the monitor's details page
* The **Services** card header

#### Traces for a specific service

To see a full list of traces for a specific service

1. In the **Services** card, find a service you want to investigate.
2. Select the  icon in the **View traces** column.

![Traces for a specific service](https://dt-cdn.net/images/screenshot-2025-05-28-104143-910-bad89d821e.png)

#### Traces for a specific execution

To see backed traces for a specific execution

1. Select **Analyze executions** at the top of the monitor's details page.
2. On the graph, select an execution to pin its tooltip.
3. Hover over the tooltip and select **View traces**.

### Navigation and filtering

The synthetic monitors page is the landing page of the ![Synthetic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-new-256-1ddb35ac79.png "Synthetic") **Synthetic** app and is the control center for your synthetic monitors. By default, the page displays all monitors in your environment, active or inactive, in a [table](#table) with key availability and performance results, so you can check the health of your monitors at a glance.
Powerful and flexible [filters](#filters) enable you to narrow your search for synthetic monitors.

To find out how to create a new monitor, see [Create monitors](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-app#create-monitors "View the synthetic monitors in your environment, search for monitors, and get a quick overview of a selected monitor.").

### Monitors table

By default, monitors with open problems (issues) are displayed alphabetically at the top of the table. Next, enabled monitors with no problems are displayed alphabetically, followed by disabled monitors displayed alphabetically.

You can hide and sort columns in ascending or descending order. Select **Columns** in the top-right corner of the table to select which columns to display or hide.

Pagination controls at the bottom of the monitor table allow you to specify the number of **rows per page** and to move through the monitor table from page to page.

The columns display the following information for each monitor.

* **Monitor name**âSelect to view a quick overview of the monitor to the right of the Synthetic monitors page
* **Created**âmonitor creation date and time
* **Last modified**âID of the user who last edited the monitor and the date and time of modification
* **ID** - full monitor identifier
* **Last execution**âdate and time of the most recent execution from any location
* **Type**âmonitor type, for example, `HTTP`
* **Frequency**âexecution frequency or `On demand`, as specified in the monitor configuration
* **Availability**âaverage availability during the selected timeframe
* **Duration**âaverage performance during the selected timeframe in seconds

In the ![Synthetic Classic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-512-83ec796e54.png "Synthetic Classic") **Synthetic** app, to display the preview panel for a monitor, select the monitor's name in the **Monitor name** column of the **Synthetic monitors** page.

To browse between your monitors, open the preview panel for any monitor and then select another monitor name to switch the preview to the newly selected monitor. Filters are persistent.

The preview panel shows:

* Tiles for important information at a glance:

  + Outage/Available/No dataâthe monitor availability status at the moment of the last executed test
  + Active issuesâthe number of issues being observed at the moment
  + Affected locationsâthe number of locations where outages happened within specific timeframe
  + Availabilityâthe monitors availability rate in percent within specific timeframe
  + Total downtimeâthe total outage time for all locations within specific timeframe
  + Durationâthe average response time for all locations within specific timeframe
* A list of problems, including the problem start date and duration, or **No problems found**. To analyze a problem in the **Problems** app, select the problem link in the list.
* A list of changes. In latest Dynatrace, this section displays changes to the monitor: when it was changed, who changed it, and what they changed. You can only access changes from a specified timeframe.
* Properties such as monitor type, locations, requests in last execution, frequency, steps, and tags.

Use the controls in the upper-right corner of the preview panel to:

* Edit the selected monitor
* Delete the selected monitor
* Enable a disabled monitor
* Disable an enabled monitor
* Display the reporting page for the selected monitor (see below)
* Close the preview panel

### Filters

Filters allowing multiple selections help you find the monitors you're looking for. You can also save frequently used filters. Expand ![Open Dashboards panel](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-app-dashboards-panel-open-6c03b43117.svg "Open Dashboards panel") or collapse ![Close Dashboards panel](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-app-dashboards-panel-close-78d6b527ad.svg "Close Dashboards panel") the filters to focus on search or results, as required. The filters are automatically collapsed when viewing the quick overview for a monitor.

The following filter categories (each with multiple options) allow you to search for monitors.

* **Type**âmonitor type
* **Ongoing issues**âmonitors with and without availability or performance problems
* **Frontend application**âassociated [RUM](/docs/observe/digital-experience "Optimize end-user experience with Digital Experience Monitoring to ensure application performance and availability across all channels.") application
* **Status**âwhether monitors are active or inactive (disabled)
* **Locations**â[public](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/general-information/public-synthetic-locations "Learn about all currently available public Synthetic Monitoring locations.") and [private](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/private-synthetic-locations/create-a-private-synthetic-location "Learn how to create a private location for synthetic monitoring.") monitoring locations
* **Device profile**âfor example, `desktop`, `Apple iPhone 8`
* **Last editor**âID of the user who last edited a monitor
* **Tags**âvalues or key-value pairs applied to monitors; you can choose tags to include or exclude from your search.
* **Edited during the timeframe**âmonitors that were or were not edited during the selected global timeframe
* **ISP / Cloud provider**âof public Synthetic locations
* **Frequency**âmonitoring frequency

#### How filters work

Within each category, you can select multiple filters. For example, when selecting monitors by **Type**, you can opt to view **HTTP** as well as **DNS** monitors. Within a category, filters are applied using the `OR` logicâmonitors matching any selection are displayed.

The filter options shown in most categories depend on your monitors; only those filters relevant to your monitors are available. For example, if you have no HTTP monitors, you won't see the **HTTP** option to filter by.

The number of monitors matching each filter is displayed. For example, the list of **Locations** shows the number of monitors per location. This number is dynamically adjusted based on your filter selections in other categories.

You can select filters in multiple categories. Filter categories are applied using the `AND` logic. For example, if you select all **Network availability** monitors (**DNS**, **ICMP**, and **TCP**) and two tags, `IP`, and `host-group`, the resulting list contains network availability monitors with either the `IP` or the `host-group` tags.

#### Filter sets

You can save combinations of filters as named filter sets for quick access to frequently used search criteriaâselect **Save new filter** and provide a filter name. You can set one filter set as default to be applied each time you go to the ![Synthetic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/synthetic-new-256-1ddb35ac79.png "Synthetic") **Synthetic** app.

Select **More** ![More actions](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-app-menu-kebab-c39eda426b.svg "More actions") next to a filter set for additional actions such as **Set as default**, **Rename**, **Duplicate**, or **Delete**.

#### Filter bar

The filter bar ![Variable](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-app-dashboard-add-variable-821b40325c.svg "Variable") at the top of the page displays a fixed filter for searching by monitor name: select **Filter by name** and enter your search string. Any additional filters or [filter sets](#filter-sets) you apply are displayed in the filter bar, from which you can clear applied filters.

### Manage synthetic monitors

### Total downtime calculation for synthetic monitors

The total monitoring time is divided into minute-level data points. All data points count as executions, although they don't necessarily coincide with actual executions.

On the screen below, the blue data points coincide with actual executions, and the white data points don't.

![Up/down executions and data points](https://dt-cdn.net/images/screenshot-2025-07-09-114246-1857-8ed42fbafd.png)

For example, if a monitor is set to execute tests every five minutes, every fifth data point (blue) coincides with an actual execution. All data points following the first failed ("down") execution and preceding the first successful ("up") execution count as "down." Thus, the total downtime is calculated as follows:

Total downtime = the first actual down execution + all following down data points.

# Synthetic for Workflows

# Synthetic for Workflows

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* 5-min read
* Updated on Jan 20, 2025

Synthetic for Workflows allows you to execute synthetic monitors on demand at selected locations within your workflows. Dynatrace can respond to any event and execute synthetic monitors within the workflows to assess its impact on user experience. Depending on the outcome, **Workflows** can notify the team by creating a Jira ticket, sending a Slack message, or initiating a remediation process.

With Synthetic for Workflows, you can choose which monitors you want to execute.

* A list of all available monitors.
* Monitors tagged with specific identifiers.
* Monitors assigned to particular frontend applications.

It is also possible to use [workflow expressions](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/workflows/reference#expressions "Get to know the workflows expression") to extract the list of monitors and locations from incoming events, which enables you to create reusable workflows.

[![Step 1](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-1-086e22066c.svg "Step 1")

**Install Synthetic for Workflows**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-for-workflows#install "Enhance your automation capabilities with Synthetic Monitoring.")[![Step 2](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-2-1a1384627e.svg "Step 2")

**Grant permissions to Workflows**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-for-workflows#permissions "Enhance your automation capabilities with Synthetic Monitoring.")

### Step 1 Install Synthetic for Workflows

To use Synthetic for Workflow actions, you first need to install **Synthetic for Workflows** from Dynatrace Hub.

1. In Dynatrace Hub ![Hub](https://dt-cdn.net/images/hub-512-82db3c583e.png "Hub"), search for **Synthetic for Workflows**.
2. Select **Synthetic for Workflows** and select **Install**.

After installation, `synthetic_for_workflows` actions appear automatically in the **Choose action** section of [**Workflows**](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/workflows "Automate IT processes with Dynatrace Workflowsâreact to events, schedule tasks, and connect services.").  
Before you begin, ensure that your monitors are properly defined. To create a new monitor, search for **Synthetic** in Dynatrace Hub ![Hub](https://dt-cdn.net/images/hub-512-82db3c583e.png "Hub").

### Step 2 Grant permissions to Workflows

The permission you need are listed in [Workflows](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/workflows#authorization "Automate IT processes with Dynatrace Workflowsâreact to events, schedule tasks, and connect services."). Additionally, for executing **Synthetic for Workflows** you need the following permissions

```
environment:roles:manage-settings,



storage:buckets:read,



storage:events:read
```

Example policy:

```
ALLOW



app-engine:apps:run,



automation:workflows:read,



app-engine:functions:run,



automation:workflows:run,



automation:workflows:write,



environment:roles:manage-settings,



storage:buckets:read,



storage:events:read;
```

## Use `synthetic_for_workflows` action

### Select synthetic monitors

To select monitors from the list for Synthetic for Workflows, you need to specify the synthetic monitors that you want to execute when the workflow is triggered. You can choose the monitor from **Visual** or **From event**.
You can find the most relevant monitors by filtering the list by various criteria such as type, name, applications, and tags.

You can also

* Select **With specific tags** to browse through monitors with a particular tag.
* Choose **Assigned to frontend applications** to select monitors assigned to particular applications. You can find the available applications in the **Select frontend applications** list.

### Select a synthetic location

In **Select a synthetic location**

1. Select **Visual** or **From event**.
2. For **Visual** select a synthetic location from the dropdown list.
3. For **From event**, you can define the list of synthetic monitors you want to execute in the workflow based on the incoming event. To do this, you need to create an [expression](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/workflows/reference#expressions "Get to know the workflows expression") that enables the workflow to extract this information from the event and execute the selected monitors.

If you don't select any location, the monitor will be executed at the location defined in the monitor configuration.

### Add metadata

With the **Add metadata** section you can enrich your synthetic result with execution context, such as the application name, version, development stage, and build version.

To add metadata

1. Select ![Add](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-app-menu-plus-7e9b7c3547.svg "Add")**Add metadata**.
2. Fill in **Key** and **Value** fields. In these fields, you can use [workflow expressions](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/workflows/reference#expressions "Get to know the workflows expression").
3. Your metadata saves automatically.

### Configure monitor execution

You can customize execution settings that will be applied to all executions within Workflows.

To do this switch on or off any of the following:

* Stop on problem
* Fail on performance issue
* Fail on SSL warning
* Take screenshots on success

### Configure workflow execution

You can configure workflow behavior if a Synthetic monitor batch execution fails.
This is done with the **Fail workflow task on failed batch execution** switch.

You can switch it on or off:

* On (  ): If monitor execution fails, the task fails.
  This can be combined with other configuration options, such as the **Retry on error** switch, to control workflow behavior according to the failing task.
* Off (  ): If monitor execution fails, the task completes successfully.
  The Synthetic for Workflows action generates results which can be used by the next task, for example [Site Reliability Guardian](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-on-grail/synthetic-for-workflows#synthetic-srg "Enhance your automation capabilities with Synthetic Monitoring.").

By default, this switch is off.

## Synthetic results in Grail

Note that Synthetic does **not** generate Grail events for non-DPS tenants. All processing will rely solely on API data. To learn more about DPS licensing, see [License Dynatrace](/docs/license "About Dynatrace Platform Subscription (DPS), the licensing model for all Dynatrace capabilities.").

Results from synthetic monitors executed on-demand are stored as events in Grail.

There are three types of events:

* `batch_status` - contains the summary result of all the monitor executions within the batch
* `browser_monitor_execution` - contains detailed information for one browser monitor execution
* `http_monitor_execution` - contains detailed information for one HTTP monitor execution

## Integrate Synthetic for Workflows with Site Reliability Guardian

If you want to evaluate objectives based on the results from synthetic monitors, you can integrate [Site Reliability Guardian (SRG)](/docs/deliver/site-reliability-guardian "Automatically validate the performance, availability, and capacity objectives of your critical services to make the right release decision.") as the next action in your workflow.

To do this

1. Select the ![Add](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-app-menu-plus-7e9b7c3547.svg "Add") on the `synthetic_for_workflows` task and then select **Site Reliability Guardian** from **Choose action**. This will trigger a `site_reliability_guardian_1` task.
2. Select the `site_reliability_guardian_1` task. In **Variables** provide the `batchId` parameter from the synthetic result and the `{{ result("synthetic_for_workflows_1")["event.id"] }}` value. You can replace `"synthetic_for_workflows_1_"` with any other task name.
3. In Dynatrace Hub ![Hub](https://dt-cdn.net/images/hub-512-82db3c583e.png "Hub"), search for **Site **Reliability** Guardian**.
4. Select **+ Guardian** button.
5. In your guardian, select ![More actions](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-app-menu-kebab-c39eda426b.svg "More actions") and select ![Summarize](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-app-menu-list-63d17138c9.svg "Summarize") **Variables**.
6. Select ![Add](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-app-menu-plus-7e9b7c3547.svg "Add") **Add variable**.
7. Type in `batchId` in the **Name** field. In the **Value** field, provide the default value. Select the **Add** button to save your changes.
8. On the right-hand side, fill in the **Guardian name**.
9. Select the ![Add](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-app-menu-plus-7e9b7c3547.svg "Add") **Add new objective** and provide one of the following [DQL](/docs/platform/grail/dynatrace-query-language "How to use Dynatrace Query Language.") queries.

Note that queries for synthetic events from outside the Synthetic application, such as those from Notebooks, Dashboards, and SRG, are **not** charged.

Use the following query to get the total duration of the whole batch.

```
fetch dt.synthetic.events



| filter event.id == $batchId



| fields batch_result.duration
```

Use the following query to check if the batch finished successfully.

```
fetch dt.synthetic.events



| filter event.id == $batchId



| filter batch.status == "Success"



| summarize count = count()
```

# Check application detection rules

# Check application detection rules

* Explanation
* 1-min read
* Published Apr 03, 2020

With application detection rules, you can define the transactions that can compromise your RUM applications. User actions detected by Dynatrace are grouped together to represent your application from the user perspective, thereby enabling standalone monitoring and analysis in Dynatrace.

You can now check if the defined detection rules are detecting traffic from the correct URLs and accurately reflecting the applications that theyâre designed to detect. By checking the URL of any auto-injected RUM application, you can:

* See exactly which detection rules match the entered URL
* Confirm that RUM is enabled for your monitored application
* Quickly access detection rule configuration by selecting the rule's **Edit** button
* Gain control over the setup and testing of your application detection rules

To better understand the defined application detection rules and their impact on your application

1. Go to **Settings** > **Web and mobile monitoring** > **Application detection**.
2. Under **Check your existing detection rules**, enter the URL, and select **Check URL**.

You can create up to 1,000 application detection rules per environment.

# Configure beacon endpoint for web applications

# Configure beacon endpoint for web applications

* How-to guide
* 6-min read
* Updated on Nov 21, 2025

The RUM JavaScript sends RUM beacons to report the captured data to Dynatrace. By default, the beacon endpoint depends on the injection method used for your application.

* **Auto-injected applications:** When the [RUM JavaScript is injected automatically](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/rum-injection "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your applications"), beacons are sent back to your web or application server using a root-relative URL where the last path segment has the `rb_` prefix (for example, `/rb_xxxxxxxxxx` or `/myapplication/rb_xxxxxxxxxx`). The beacon endpoint is provided by OneAgent, which intercepts and forwards RUM beacons.
* **Agentless applications:** If you opted for [agentless monitoring](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/set-up-agentless-real-user-monitoring "Set up agentless monitoring for your web applications."), data is sent to a beacon endpoint that is part of the Dynatrace SaaS infrastructure.

You usually don't need to change the default beacon endpoint, but there are certain scenarios where you might need to use an alternative beacon endpoint configuration. For example:

* If your infrastructure blocks beacons of an auto-injected application because of their default URL path.
* If you want the monitoring traffic of an auto-injected application to bypass your CDN.
* If you prefer RUM beacons not to be handled on the web or application server that hosts your application.

The following sections describe alternative beacon endpoint configurations that allow you to accommodate these and similar constraints.

The beacon endpoint configurations explained on this page don't affect the correlation between user actions and distributed traces. However, check [Technology support](/docs/ingest-from/technology-support#rum-auto-injection "Find technical details related to Dynatrace support for specific platforms and development frameworks.") to see if Real User Monitoring is supported for your technology.

## Auto-injected app Modify the beacon endpoint URL

Depending on your infrastructure and its configuration, it's possible that beacons can't pass with their automatically chosen URL path and thus can't be handled by OneAgent. To solve this, you can change the part of the beacon endpoint URL that comes before the `rb_` prefix.

To modify the beacon endpoint URL for an auto-injected application

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **General settings** > **Beacon endpoint**.
5. In the **Type** dropdown list, select **OneAgent**.
6. In **URL**, enter the relative beacon endpoint URL.

Note that you can't remove the path segment prefixed by `rb_`, as itâs required for OneAgent to identify RUM beacons.

#### Examples

The following examples assume that RUM beacons are sent to `/rb_bf12345abc` by default.

* **Root-relative URL:** If you set **URL** to `/custompath`, the beacons will be sent to `/custompath/rb_bf12345abc`.
* **Relative URL:** If you set **URL** to `./`, then the URL where the RUM JavaScript sends beacons is relative to the current page. For example:

  + If the current page is `/shop/index.html`, then the beacons are sent to `/shop/rb_bf12345abc`.
  + If the current page is `/account/dashboard/`, then the beacons are sent to `/account/dashboard/rb_bf12345abc`.

## Auto-injected app Send beacons to Dynatrace SaaS infrastructure

If you want the RUM beacons of an auto-injected application to be handled by the Dynatrace SaaS infrastructure instead of OneAgent, follow the steps below.

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **General settings** > **Beacon endpoint**.
5. In the **Type** dropdown list, select **Cluster ActiveGate**.

For this configuration, Dynatrace applies the [beacon origin allowlist](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/configure-beacon-domain-allowlist "Specify the origins from which cross-origin RUM beacons should be accepted.") to the RUM beacons of your application.

## Auto-injected app Send beacons to a different web server

By default, the RUM beacons of an auto-injected application are handled by one of the process groups that hosts your application. Alternatively, beacons can be handled on any other instrumented web or application server of a technology listed in [Technology support - Real User Monitoring - Web servers and applications](/docs/ingest-from/technology-support#rum-auto-injection "Find technical details related to Dynatrace support for specific platforms and development frameworks.").

To send beacons of an auto-injected application to a different instrumented server

1. In the injected RUM JavaScript, find `reportUrl` and copy the last segment of the URL path, which is prefixed with `rb_`.
2. Append this value to the URL of the instrumented web or application server.

   For example, if the last segment of `reportUrl` is `/rb_abcdefghi` and the server URL is `http://www.my-server.com`, the resulting beacon endpoint URL is `http://www.my-server.com/rb_abcdefghi`.
3. Go to **Web**.
4. Select the application that you want to configure.
5. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
6. From the application settings, select **General settings** > **Beacon endpoint**.
7. In the **Type** dropdown list, select **OneAgent**.
8. In **URL**, enter the beacon endpoint that you determined in step 2.
9. Turn on **Send beacon data via CORS**.

For this configuration, Dynatrace applies the [beacon origin allowlist](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/configure-beacon-domain-allowlist "Specify the origins from which cross-origin RUM beacons should be accepted.") to the RUM beacons of your application.

## Agentless app Send beacons to a web server

Instead of using the Dynatrace SaaS infrastructure as a beacon endpoint for your agentless application, you can use any instrumented web or application server of a technology listed in [Technology support - Real User Monitoring - Web servers and applications](/docs/ingest-from/technology-support#rum-auto-injection "Find technical details related to Dynatrace support for specific platforms and development frameworks.").

To send beacons of an agentless application to an instrumented server

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select any **auto-injected** application that doesn't use one of the custom beacon endpoint configurations described on this page.

   In this step, you should select not the agentless application that you're configuring but another **auto-injected** application that has the default beacon endpoint configuration. If you don't have an auto-injected application, temporarily create one as described in [Define applications for Real User Monitoring | Application detection rules approach](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/define-your-applications-via-the-my-web-application-placeholder#application-detection-rules "Learn how to define your applications following the suggested, manual, or application detection rules approach."). You can then [delete](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/delete-application-web "Delete your web applications via the Dynatrace web UI or API.") this temporary application.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **Injection** > **Manual insertion**.
5. Under **OneAgent JavaScript tag**, find `reportUrl` in the provided snippet, and copy its value.
6. Append the `reportUrl` value to the URL of the instrumented web or application server.

   For example, if the `reportUrl` value is `/rb_abcdefghi` and the server URL is `http://www.my-server.com`, the resulting beacon endpoint URL is `http://www.my-server.com/rb_abcdefghi`.
7. Go to **Web**.
8. Select the agentless application that you want to configure.
9. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
10. From the application settings, select **General settings** > **Beacon endpoint**.
11. In the **Type** dropdown list, select **OneAgent**.
12. In **URL**, enter the beacon endpoint that you determined in step 6.
13. Turn on **Send beacon data via CORS**.

For this configuration, Dynatrace applies the [beacon origin allowlist](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/configure-beacon-domain-allowlist "Specify the origins from which cross-origin RUM beacons should be accepted.") to the RUM beacons of your application (the same is done for the default beacon endpoint configuration for all agentless applications).

# Capture additional interaction types for web applications

# Capture additional interaction types for web applications

* How-to guide
* 2-min read
* Updated on Mar 20, 2023

For [XHR actions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-actions#xhr-action "Learn what user actions are and how they help you understand what users do with your application."), Real User Monitoring detects the following interaction types:

* Click
* Double click
* Mouse down
* Mouse up
* Scroll

* Key down
* Key up
* Touch start
* Touch end
* Change

To select which interaction types Dynatrace should capture automatically

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **Capturing** > **Advanced setup**.
5. Scroll down to the **Wrappers for addEventListener and attachEvent** section, and use the toggles to include or exclude the interaction types from being captured. Some of the options are available for both **Global event capture** and `addEventListener`/`attachEvent` modes.

   Difference between Global event capture and addEventListener / attachEvent options

   The **Global event capture** option registers a single listener on the document object of the page to capture fired events.

   The `addEventListener`/`attachEvent` module walks through the DOM nodes and registers listeners directly on the specific elements. Instead of registering a single global listener on the document object (in case of the **Global event capture** option), this module adds listeners on all buttons, input elements, and other UI elements. This increases overhead because all DOM nodes must be scanned.

   You might need to use the `addEventListener`/`attachEvent` module in the following cases:

   * When your setup stops the propagation of events
   * When the JavaScript setup framework prevents adding a listener on the document element itself
   * In case of another unique security setup

# Configure error detection for web applications

# Configure error detection for web applications

* How-to guide
* 8-min read
* Updated on Jul 12, 2022

To set up how errors are captured, edit your application and expand the **Errors** section. Select the required error type and then configure an error to be captured, included in [Apdex calculations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/scores-and-ratings/apdex-ratings "Learn how Dynatrace uses Apdex to measure user satisfaction with application performance."), or considered for [Davis AI problem detection and analysis](/docs/dynatrace-intelligence "Get familiar with the capabilities of Dynatrace Intelligence.").

## Error types

Dynatrace categorizes [errors](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#error "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace.") into the following types.

* **Request errors** are detected by the browser and OneAgent on your servers.
* **Custom errors** are triggered directly in your application via the [RUM JavaScript API](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/customize-rum "Find out how to customize Real User Monitoring using the JavaScript API.").
* **JavaScript errors** are detected JavaScript exceptions thrown by the browser.

## Configure request errors

By default, Dynatrace considers all `4xx` and `5xx` HTTP status codes to be request errors. CSP violations and errors with failed image requests are also captured as request errors. In addition, the RUM JavaScript can also use [custom status codes](#custom-status-codes) to inform you of framework issues.

You can change the default settings by configuring request error rules.

### Add a request error rule

To add a request error rule

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **Errors** > **Request errors**.
5. Select **Add request error rule**.
6. Use at least one of the following options:

   * **Match by error code**. Provide either an individual HTTP error code, such as `404`, or a whole error code range, such as `400-499`.
   * **Match by errors that have failed image requests**
   * **Match by errors that have CSP violations**
7. Optional To apply the request error rule only to certain URLs, adjust the options under **Filter settings**.
8. Specify if you want to **Capture this error**. Also, you can **Include error in Apdex calculations** and **Include error in Davis AI problem detection and analysis**.

   ![Configuring a request error rule](https://dt-cdn.net/images/configure-request-error-1188-fed713c886.png)

   If you opt for including the error in Davis AI analysis, Davis may report this error as a new open problem.

The request error rules are executed in the order of their appearance in the error list. Select and hold **Drag row** ![Drag handle](https://dt-cdn.net/images/drag-handle-turquoise-600-1aa0e5ea00.svg "Drag handle") next to the rule name, and move the rule up or down in the list to change its priority.

You can also turn on **Ignore request errors in Apdex calculations** to override Apdex settings for individual request error rules.

### Manage custom status codes

Besides capturing standard HTTP error codes, the RUM JavaScript can also use custom status codes to signal that it detected a framework issue.

For applications created with Dynatrace version 1.238+, the RUM JavaScript reports some request errors using custom status codes `970`â`979` when the real HTTP status code can't be captured. Note that these custom status codes are not real HTTP status codes; they just mean that the RUM JavaScript detected an error fired by the framework you use.

Whether such request errors affect your users depends on your application. For example, if you send a request to a tracking service and the request is canceled, such an error hardly impacts the users of your application. However, a failed payment request would definitely inconvenience them.

The RUM JavaScript uses the following custom status codes:

| Code | Name | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 970 | Error | An unspecified error occurred in the used framework. |
| 971 | Canceled | The request was canceled. |
| 972 | Timeout | The request ran into a timeout. |
| 973 | Parse | Parsing the response failed. Reported by XMLHttpRequest, jQuery, and MooTools module. |
| 974 | Setup | An error occurred during the request setup. Only reported by MooTools module. |
| 979 | Unknown | An unknown framework error occurred. Only reported by jQuery and MooTools module. |

#### Applications created starting with Dynatrace version 1.238

For applications created starting with Dynatrace version 1.238, these custom status codes are detected automatically. They're included in Apdex calculations but are not considered for Davis AI analysis.

If you want to ignore these custom status codes, delete or disable the **HTTP 970-979** request error rule.

To delete or disable the **HTTP 970-979** request error rule

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **Errors** > **Request errors**.
5. Find the **HTTP 970-979** error rule, and do one of the following:

   * Select **Delete row** ![Remove](https://dt-cdn.net/images/remove-icon-105c6a04c2.svg "Remove") to completely delete this request error rule.
   * Expand the rule, and turn off **Capture this error**.

#### Applications created before Dynatrace version 1.238

For applications created with Dynatrace versions earlier than 1.238, the custom status codes are not used. If you want to capture these codes, [add a request error rule](#configure-request-errors) with the following settings:

* **Match by error code**: `970-979`
* **Capture this error**: `Enabled`
* **Include error in Apdex calculations**: `Enabled` or `Disabled` based on your needs
* **Include error in Davis AI problem detection and analysis**: `Enabled` or `Disabled` based on your needs

## Configure custom errors

Custom errors allow you to detect your own errors. An example of this is an error that is triggered during a form field validation.

For setting up a custom error, configure how Dynatrace should treat the error, and then trigger the error in your application using the [RUM JavaScript API](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/customize-rum "Find out how to customize Real User Monitoring using the JavaScript API.").

To add a custom error rule

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **Errors** > **Custom errors**.
5. Select **Add custom error rule**.
6. Provide the conditions that Dynatrace should use to identify the custom error.

   * Use **Match key** and **Key pattern** for the custom error `key`.
   * Use **Match value** and **Value pattern** for the custom error `value`.

     Custom error rules are case-insensitive. For example, values such as `mykey` and `MyKeY` are treated the same.
7. Specify if you want to **Capture this error**. Also, you can **Include error in Apdex calculations** and **Include error in Davis AI problem detection and analysis**.

   ![Configuring a custom error rule](https://dt-cdn.net/images/configure-custom-error-1188-d01572ccac.png)

   If you opt for including the error in Davis AI analysis, Davis may report this error as a new open problem.

The custom error rules are executed in the order of their appearance in the error list. Select and hold **Drag row** ![Drag handle](https://dt-cdn.net/images/drag-handle-turquoise-600-1aa0e5ea00.svg "Drag handle") next to the rule name, and move the rule up or down in the list to change its priority.

You can also turn on **Ignore custom errors in Apdex calculations** to override Apdex settings for individual custom error rules.

After adding or excluding a custom error in Dynatrace, you must trigger the error in your application using the `dtrum.reportCustomError()` method of the [RUM JavaScript API](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/customize-rum "Find out how to customize Real User Monitoring using the JavaScript API.").

For example, a form field error would require the following JavaScript method parameters:

| Parameter | Explanation | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `key` | The name of the form field. | `custom_buying_form_number_of_travelers_field` |
| `value` | The validation error triggered by the validator. | `availability exceeded - e3434` |
| `hint` | The actual user input. | `1000` |

Only `key` and `value` can be used to group and analyze custom errors; `hint` is optional information.

For more information on how to report custom errors, see [RUM JavaScript API - reportCustomErrorï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/doc/javascriptapi/doc/types/dtrum.html#reportcustomerror).

## Configure JavaScript errors

Browsers detect JavaScript errors automatically, so you don't have to add these errors. If you configure JavaScript errors to be captured, they are automatically included in Apdex calculations and Davis analysis.

To ignore JavaScript errors on an individual level, select **Ignore this JavaScript error** on the respective JavaScript error details page.

![Ignoring a JavaScript error](https://dt-cdn.net/images/ignore-js-error-1217-3c39f37cfa.png)

To ignore all JavaScript errors in Apdex calculations

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **Errors** > **JavaScript errors**.
5. Turn on **Ignore JavaScript errors in Apdex calculations**.

## Create additional error alerts for Davis

If the out-of-the-box alerting on request, custom, and JavaScript errors is not sensitive enough for you, or if you want to focus on an individual error, you can create additional error alerts.

To create additional error alerts

1. Go to **Web** and select the application to display the application overview page.
2. In the infographic, select **Errors**.
3. Under **Errors by type**, select **Analyze by type**.
4. Under **Detail analysis for selected timeframe**, set filters in the **Filter byâ¦** box. Available filters in the **Errors** category are `Custom error name`, `Custom error type`, `Error type`, `Errors`, `Request error code`, `Request error resource`, and `Request error type`.
5. Select **Create metric**.
6. In the opened overlay, adjust the metric settings, and select **Create metric**.  
   For details on creating and charting calculated metrics, see [Create calculated metrics for web applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/rum-calculated-metrics-web "Create calculated metrics as well as custom charts based on calculated metrics for your web applications.").
7. Select **Create alert**.
8. Configure the alert settings. When done, select **Create custom event for alerting**.

   For details on creating an alert, see [Metric events](/docs/dynatrace-intelligence/anomaly-detection/metric-events "Learn about metric events in Dynatrace").

   Use a static threshold of `1` if you want Davis to always raise a problem when a particular error occurs. If you're interested only in anomalies for that error, use [auto-baselining](/docs/dynatrace-intelligence/anomaly-detection/automated-multidimensional-baselining "Learn how Dynatrace AI automatically calculates baselines based on a multi-dimensional baselining scheme.").

# Configure key user actions for web applications

# Configure key user actions for web applications

* How-to guide
* 1-min read
* Published Jan 27, 2023

Most applications include user actions that are particularly important to the success of your digital business. Examples of these actions are signups, checkouts, and product searches. Such [key user actions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-actions#key-user-actions "Learn what user actions are and how they help you understand what users do with your application.") might take longer to execute than others, or they might have the requirement to be of a shorter-than-average duration.

With the key user action feature, you can [customize the Apdex thresholds](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/scores-and-ratings/apdex-ratings#key-user-actions "Learn how Dynatrace uses Apdex to measure user satisfaction with application performance.") for each of these user actions. You can use this feature to monitor key actions with a dedicated dashboard tile and track historical trends.

## Mark a user action as a key user action

1. Go to **Frontend**.
2. Select the application and scroll down to **Top 3 user actions** or **Top 3 actions**.
3. Select **View full details** or **Analyze performance**.
4. Scroll down to see the list of user actions, and select the required user action.  
   The user action detail page opens.
5. In the upper-right corner of the user action detail page, select **Mark as key user action**.

You can define up to 500 key user actions per environment across all your applications and up to 100 key user actions per application.

When you reach the maximum key user action limit, consider using calculated metrics (available for your [web](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/rum-calculated-metrics-web "Create calculated metrics as well as custom charts based on calculated metrics for your web applications."), [mobile](/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications/additional-configuration/rum-calculated-metrics-mobile "Create calculated metrics as well as custom charts based on calculated metrics for your mobile applications."), and [custom applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/custom-applications/additional-configuration/rum-calculated-metrics-custom "Create calculated metrics as well as custom charts based on calculated metrics for your custom applications.")), which offer similar capabilities.

## Pin a key user action to dashboard

[Dashboards Classic](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/dashboards-classic "Learn how to create, manage, and use Dynatrace Dashboards Classic.")

1. Go to **Frontend**.
2. Select the application and scroll down to **Top 3 user actions** or **Top 3 actions**.
3. Select **View full details** or **Analyze performance**.
4. Search for the required key user action and select it.  
   The user action detail page opens.
5. In the upper part of the user action detail page, select **Pin to dashboard**. For details, see [Pin tiles to your dashboard](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/dashboards-classic/charts-and-tiles/pin-tiles-to-your-dashboard "Learn to pin tiles to your dashboards.").

## Customize Apdex rating for a key user action

To change the Apdex thresholds for a key user action

1. Go to **Frontend**.
2. Select the application and scroll down to **Top 3 user actions** or **Top 3 actions**.
3. Select **View full details** or **Analyze performance**.
4. Search for the required key user action and select it.  
   The user action detail page opens.
5. In the upper-right corner of the user action detail page, do one of the following:

   * For web applications, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit** > **Key performance metric**.
   * For mobile and custom applications, select ![Expand](https://dt-cdn.net/images/expandbutton-40-e1f11ff81d.png "Expand") (**Expand**) > **Edit** > **Key performance metric**.
6. Use the slider to adjust the Apdex thresholds.

# Configure the Real User Monitoring code source

# Configure the Real User Monitoring code source

* How-to guide
* 4-min read
* Updated on Nov 21, 2025

In the majority of RUM scenarios, at least one additional request for monitoring code is issued by the browser:

* All snippet formats except for [inline code](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats#inline-code "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case") include monitoring code as an external resource, which is requested separately by the browser.
* The monitoring code for Session Replay is always requested separately, even if the used tag format is inline code.

The default URL of the requested monitoring code depends on the injection method used for your application.

* **Agentless applications:** If you opted for [agentless monitoring](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/set-up-agentless-real-user-monitoring "Set up agentless monitoring for your web applications."), the monitoring code is requested from the Dynatrace CDN. In case of the tag format [JavaScript tag](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats#js-tag "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case"), the filename ends with `_complete.js` and contains an application identifier (for example, `7cab1abeacdfe1_complete.js`). For all other formats, it starts with `ruxitagent_` and contains information about the active code modules and monitoring code version (for example, `ruxitagent_ICA7NQVfqrtux_10307250124095659.js`). The filename of the Session Replay monitoring code starts with `ruxitagent_` (for example, `ruxitagent_D_10307250124095659.js`) for all tag formats.
* **Automatic injection:** If the [RUM JavaScript is injected automatically](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/rum-injection "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your applications"), both RUM and Session Replay monitoring code are requested from your web or application server using a root-relative URL where the filename starts with `ruxitagentjs_` and contains information about the active code modules and monitoring code version (for example, `/ruxitagentjs_ICA7NQVfqrtux_10307250124095659.js` or `/myapplication/ruxitagentjs_ICA7NQVfqrtux_10307250124095659.js`).
* **Manual insertion for pages of an auto-injected application:** If the [RUM JavaScript is inserted manually even though your process groups are instrumented with OneAgent](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/rum-injection#manual-insertion-using-oneagent "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your applications"), the monitoring code, like with automatic injection, is requested from your web or application server using a root-relative URL where the filename starts with `ruxitagentjs_`. The only exception here is the tag format JavaScript tag, where the RUM monitoring code is requested from the CDN and the filename ends with `_complete.js`. The Session Replay monitoring code is requested from your web or application server and has a filename starting with `ruxitagentjs_` for all tag formats.

You usually don't need to do this, but there are certain scenarios where you might need to use an alternative monitoring code source configuration. For example:

* If your infrastructure blocks monitoring code requests of an auto-injected application because of their default URL path.
* If you prefer monitoring code requests not to be handled on the web or application server that hosts your application.
* If you want to prevent ad blockers from blocking the monitoring code.

The following sections describe alternative configurations that allow you to accommodate these constraints.

## Auto-injected app Modify the monitoring code URL path

Depending on your infrastructure and its configuration, it's possible that requests for monitoring code can't pass with their automatically chosen URL path and thus can't be handled by OneAgent. To solve this, you can change the part of the URL that comes before the `ruxitagentjs_` prefix.

To modify the RUM monitoring code URL path for an auto-injected application

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **Injection** > **Automatic injection**.
5. In the **Real User Monitoring code source** dropdown list, select **OneAgent**.
6. In **Specify path for RUM monitoring code**, enter the relative monitoring code URL path.

Note that you can't eliminate the path segment prefixed by `ruxitagentjs_`, which is necessary for the identification of the request as a monitoring code request.

#### Examples

The following examples assume that the monitoring code is requested from `/ruxitagentjs_ICA7NQVfqrtux_10307250124095659.js` by default.

* **Root-relative URL:** If you configure the path `/custompath`, the monitoring code will be requested from `/custompath/ruxitagentjs_ICA7NQVfqrtux_10307250124095659.js`.
* **Relative URL:** If you configure the path `./`, the URL where the monitoring code is requested from is relative to the current page. For example:

  + If the current page is `/shop/index.html`, then the monitoring code is requested from `/shop/ruxitagentjs_ICA7NQVfqrtux_10307250124095659.js`.
  + If the current page is `/account/dashboard/`, then the monitoring code is requested from `/account/dashboard/ruxitagentjs_ICA7NQVfqrtux_10307250124095659.js`.

This configuration is not only effective for automatic injection, but also for [manual insertion for pages of an auto-injected application](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/rum-injection#manual-insertion-using-oneagent "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your applications"). The only exception is the `_complete.js` request for the JavaScript tag format, which will still go to the Dynatrace CDN.

## Auto-injected app Request the monitoring code from the Dynatrace CDN

Note that all connected ActiveGates must be on ActiveGate version 1.310+ for at least 30 days before this feature becomes available.

If you want the monitoring code for an auto-injected application to be requested from the Dynatrace CDN instead of OneAgent, follow the steps below.

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **Injection** > **Automatic injection**.
5. In the **Real User Monitoring code source** dropdown list, select **CDN**.

This configuration is effective for both automatic injection and [manual insertion for pages of an auto-injected application](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/rum-injection#manual-insertion-using-oneagent "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your applications"). Using it, filenames previously starting with `ruxitagentjs_` will start with `ruxitagent_` instead.

## Configure a custom monitoring code filename prefix

After changing the monitoring code filename prefix, you may experience a temporary reduction in collected RUM data. Therefore, we recommend avoiding frequent changes to this setting.

By default, the monitoring code filename is prefixed with `ruxitagent` or `ruxitagentjs`, unless the tag format JavaScript tag is used. Alternatively, you can specify a custom prefix, which will be used instead for both agentless and auto-injected applications, as well as for both RUM and Session Replay monitoring code.

To specify a custom monitoring code filename prefix

1. Go to **Settings** > **Web and mobile monitoring** > **RUM monitoring code filename**.

# Configure the RUM cookie domain for web applications

# Configure the RUM cookie domain for web applications

* How-to guide
* 4-min read
* Published Mar 21, 2022

Dynatrace Real User Monitoring uses HTTP cookies to group user actions into sessions and link user actions with their corresponding [distributed traces](/docs/observe/application-observability/distributed-traces "Gain observability into highly distributed, cloud-native architectures to effectively trace and analyze transactions in real time."). Browsers include a cookie in the `Cookie` request header only if the request URL lies within the scope of the cookie, which is specified by the `Domain` and `Path` cookie attributes.

Dynatrace always sets the `Path` attribute of the RUM cookies to `/` so that the cookie scope covers all URL paths within a domain. The `Domain` attribute is determined automatically by default, but you can also [configure it manually for each application](#configure-cookie-domain).

## Automatic cookie domain determination

If you haven't [configured the cookie domain](#configure-cookie-domain), Dynatrace determines it automatically. Dynatrace chooses the [effective top-level domain plus one (eTLD+1)ï»¿](https://web.dev/same-site-same-origin/) of the request URL. For example, Dynatrace chooses the `example.com` cookie domain for the `www.example.com` domain or the `example.co.uk` cookie domain for the `www.example.co.uk` domain. With this choice, Dynatrace can capture a continuous session even when your users visit multiple subdomains while interacting with your applications, for example, when they navigate from `www.example.com` to `shop.example.com`.

The cookie domain is determined either on the server side by OneAgent or on the client side by the RUM JavaScript, depending on which one is the first to capture a user's interaction with your application. If the RUM JavaScript is injected automatically, it's usually OneAgent that determines the cookie domain. However, when the browser takes a page from the cache, the RUM JavaScript determines the cookie domain.

### Possible issues with automatic cookie domain determination

OneAgent uses the result of host name determination as a starting point when it determines the cookie domain. If there is an uninstrumented component that rewrites the host portion of the URL, it is crucial for automatic cookie domain determination that host name determination is configured correctly. For details, see [What can I do if an uninstrumented component rewrites parts of the URL?](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/define-your-applications-via-the-my-web-application-placeholder#rum-appdetection-uninstrumentedcomponent "Learn how to define your applications following the suggested, manual, or application detection rules approach.")

## Manual cookie domain configuration

In most scenarios, there is no need to configure the cookie domain manually. There are, however, two use cases when this is necessary:

* You need to separate the user actions of different subdomains into separate user sessions.
* Automatic determination of the cookie domain does not work because an uninstrumented component rewrites the host portion of the URL and does not forward the original host information in a request header. The preferable solution is to configure the component to add such a header (see [What can I do if an uninstrumented component rewrites parts of the URL?](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/define-your-applications-via-the-my-web-application-placeholder#rum-appdetection-uninstrumentedcomponent "Learn how to define your applications following the suggested, manual, or application detection rules approach.") for instructions). However, manual configuration of the cookie domain is also a possible workaround.

### Configure cookie domain manually

To configure the cookie domain

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **Injection** > **Cookie**.
5. In **Domain to be used for cookie placement**, enter the required domain.

### Possible issues with manual configuration

#### Configured cookie domain is a public suffix

Browsers do not allow you to set cookies with a `Domain` attribute that exceeds a single organization's boundary. Therefore, setting the cookie domain to a [public suffixï»¿](https://publicsuffix.org/list/) does not work.

#### Multiple domains without a common eTLD+1 are mapped into the configured application

Since the cookie domain is configured per application, all domains that map to your application should have at least a common eTLD+1 to allow cookie domain definition.

For example, you cannot manually configure the cookie domain for an application where both `www.example.com` and `www.example.co.uk` map. If you choose the cookie domain `example.com`, the browser rejects the RUM cookies on requests to `www.example.co.uk`.

#### Overlapping cookie domains

If you configure the cookie domain for all or some of your applications manually, you must ensure that the cookie domains of your applications do not overlap.

Consider the following example. The `www.example.com` domain is mapped to the **Example app**, while the `shop.example.com` domain is mapped to the **Shopping app**. By default, the `example.com` cookie domain is detected automatically for both domains. If you set the `shop.example.com` cookie domain for the **Shopping app** and your users navigate back and forth between the two applications, ambiguous situations will arise since the RUM cookies for the **Example app** have the `example.com` cookie domain and therefore are also applicable to the **Shopping app**, which has another set of RUM cookies with the `shop.example.com` domain. With this configuration, Dynatrace might randomly split the captured RUM data into short user sessions and user actions, and distributed traces might be not be linked as expected.

# Configure first-party, third-party, and CDN resource detection for web applications

# Configure first-party, third-party, and CDN resource detection for web applications

* How-to guide
* 1-min read
* Updated on Jun 30, 2022

Dynatrace recognizes more than 1,000 third-party content providers, including Google, Amazon, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Typical third-party content includes Facebook and Twitter widgets, gravatars, and similar resources. It's crucial to see how third-party content providers affect your applications and understand if such content is the root cause of any slowdowns.

Content delivery networks (CDNs) are usually under your control. Your application might use a CDN to store and serve frequently accessed static and dynamic content, which is required to speed up load times in certain geographic regions.

## Difference between third-party providers and CDNs

The difference between third-party content providers and CDNs lies in the control you have over the data.

* If you use external data that you have no control over, the content comes from a third-party provider.
* If you rely on an external resource to deliver static or dynamic content to your application, for example, images or CSS, think of the service as a CDN.

## View your application's top providers

You can view your application's top providers and access the detailed information on each provider from your application overview page. For details, see [Performance analysis > Resources](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/performance-analysis#resources "Understand the available types of performance analysis that are provided by Dynatrace.").

## Manage your environment's providers

### View the full list of providers

Dynatrace detects lots of third-party content providers. When Dynatrace cannot find a host name in the list of known third-party providers, it marks the resource as CDN. Also, Dynatrace can find out which domains your organization hosts and categorize those domains as first-party.

To see the full list of providers detected for your environment, go to **Settings** > **Web and mobile monitoring** > **Provider breakdown**.

* Manually added providers are listed directly under the **Add custom provider item** button. You can [add a provider](#add-provider-manually) and mark it as a first-party, third-party, or CDN.
* Automatically detected CDNs and third-party providers are listed under **Auto detected providers**.

![Provider breakdown settings](https://dt-cdn.net/images/provider-breakdown-settings-1267-bfe07292b6.png)

### Add a provider manually

If you can't find your provider in the list of auto-detected providers or want to override auto-detection rules, you can add a provider manually.

To manually add a provider

1. Go to **Settings** > **Web and mobile monitoring** > **Provider breakdown**.
2. Select **Add custom provider item**.
3. Enter the **Resource name**, and set the **Resource type** to specify if the resource is first-party, third-party, or CDN.
4. Optional Provide a URL for the provider's brand icon.
5. Select **Add name pattern**, and then enter the pattern for the provider's domain name. You can specify several patterns if required.
6. Optional Turn on **Submit this provider-pattern to improve auto-detection** if you believe Dynatrace should automatically detect this resource as a third-party resource.

Starting with Dynatrace version 1.240, auto-detection of first-party providers is enabled by default and cannot be deactivated. If you need to override the auto-detected first-party providers, [add a provider manually](#add-provider-manually).

### Reorganize manually added providers

The list of manually added providers is processed in the order of their appearance in the list. For this reason, a provider with a more specific domain pattern should come first. For example, `api.example.com` should come before `example.com`.

To change the order of manually added providers

1. Go to **Settings** > **Web and mobile monitoring** > **Provider breakdown**.
2. Find the list of manually added providers under the **Add custom provider item** button.
3. Use **Drag handle** ![Drag handle](https://dt-cdn.net/images/drag-handle-turquoise-600-1aa0e5ea00.svg "Drag handle") to change a provider's priority.

A [user experience score](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/scores-and-ratings/user-experience-score "User experience score is a metric used to categorize user sessions as Frustrating, Tolerable, or Satisfying.") is an important metric that reflects the overall performance, usability, and detected errors of each session. You can adjust the user experience score thresholds for your applications.

To set up the user experience score thresholds

1. Go to **Settings** > **Web and mobile monitoring** > **User experience score**.

   ![User experience score settings](https://dt-cdn.net/images/user-xp-score-settings-2292-03a4586d9e.png)
2. Optional Turn on **If last user action in a session is classified as Frustrating, classify the entire session as Frustrating** to judge a frustrating session by its last action.
3. Optional Turn on **Consider rage clicks / rage taps in score calculation** to include [rage events](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#rage-event "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace.") when determining the user experience score.
4. In the **Threshold for Frustrating user experience** box, enter the percentage of **Frustrating** user actions beyond which a user session is considered **Frustrating**.
5. In the **Threshold for Satisfying user experience** box, enter the minimum percentage of **Satisfying** user actions required to consider a session **Satisfying**.

# Create USQL custom metrics for web applications

# Create USQL custom metrics for web applications

* How-to guide
* 1-min read
* Updated on Feb 21, 2023

With USQL metric events, you can extract business-level KPI metrics from your user session and user action data and store these metrics as time series. You can then use the stored metrics in [custom charts](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/explorer "Query for metrics and transform results to gain desired insights."), [alerting mechanisms](/docs/dynatrace-intelligence/anomaly-detection/metric-events "Learn about metric events in Dynatrace"), or [Metrics API](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/metric-v2 "Retrieve metric information via Metrics v2 API.").

USQL metric events are available as:

* **User session metric events**. These metrics are abbreviated as USCMs and have the `uscm.` prefix.
* **User action metric events**. These metrics are abbreviated as UACMs and start with the `uacm.` prefix.

User action metric events are available since Dynatrace version 1.260.

USQL metric events can help you answer questions such as:

* How is the user experience index for my website changing over time?
* How is the Apdex index for a given type of user actions changing over time?
* How is the revenue generated by my users changing over time?
* How many users are coming to my website and what browsers are they using?
* What is the average session duration for my web application?
* What is the average user action duration for my mobile application?

You can create and manage USQL metric events using either the Dynatrace web UI or the [Dynatrace Settings API](#create-metrics-via-API).

## Configure metrics via UI

You can create and manage USQL metric events using the Dynatrace web UI.

![User session metric events page in the Dynatrace web UI](https://dt-cdn.net/images/user-session-custom-metrics-page-2112-726ab6bf4a.png)

1. Go to **Settings** > **Web and mobile monitoring** > **User session metric events** or **User action metric events**.
2. Select **Add item**.
3. Enter the **Metric key** that should be used when ingesting the metric. You'll use this key when requesting the metric data via [Data Explorer](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/explorer "Query for metrics and transform results to gain desired insights.").

   * For user session metric events, start the metric key with the `uscm.` prefix.
   * For user action metric events, start the metric key with the `uacm.` prefix.
4. Under **Value type to be extracted**, select one of the following options.

   * For user session metric events:

     + **User session counter** to count the number of user sessions, which is similar to `COUNT(*)` when using [USQL](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/custom-queries-segmentation-and-aggregation-of-session-data "Learn how you can access and query user session data based on keywords, syntax, functions, and more.").
     + **User session field value** to extract a value of a user session field. Also, specify the **Field name**. For possible values, see [Values for user session metric events](#values-uscm).
   * For user action metric events:

     + **User action counter** to count the number of user actions, which is similar to `COUNT(*)` when using [USQL](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/custom-queries-segmentation-and-aggregation-of-session-data "Learn how you can access and query user session data based on keywords, syntax, functions, and more.").
     + **User action field value** to extract a value of a user action field. Also, specify the **Field name**. For possible values, see [Values for user action metric events](#values-uacm).
5. Under **Add a dimension**, specify fields that should be used as dimensions. For possible values, see [Dimensions for user session metric events](#dimensions-uscm) and [Dimensions for user action metric events](#dimensions-uacm).
6. Under **Add a filter**, include the required filters.

   * Enter the **Field name**. For possible values, see [Filters for user session metric events](#filters-uscm) or [Filters for user action metric events](#filters-uacm).
   * Select the **Operator**.
   * If you've selected one of the binary operators, for example, **equals** or **greater than**, also provide the second argument in the **Value** text field.

![Creating a user session custom metric](https://dt-cdn.net/images/creating-user-session-custom-metric-1359-e1cdae0345.png)

Alternatively, you can use [USQL](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/custom-queries-segmentation-and-aggregation-of-session-data#convert-usql-into-custom-metrics "Learn how you can access and query user session data based on keywords, syntax, functions, and more.") to create USQL metric events.

## Configure metrics via API

You can also use the [Settings API](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/settings "Find out what the Dynatrace Settings API offers.") to configure USQL metric events.

1. [Create an access token](/docs/dynatrace-api/basics/dynatrace-api-authentication#create-token "Find out how to get authenticated to use the Dynatrace API.") with the **Write settings** (`settings.write`) and **Read settings** (`settings.read`) permissions.
2. Use the [GET a schema](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/settings/schemas/get-schema "View a settings schema via the Dynatrace API.") endpoint to learn the JSON format required to post your configuration.

   User session custom metric

   User action custom metric

   The metric configuration schema identifier (`schemaId`) is `builtin:custom-metrics`.

   Here is an example JSON payload with the user session custom metric configuration:

   ```
   [



   {



   "schemaVersion":"0.0.4",



   "schemaId":"builtin:custom-metrics",



   "scope":"tenant",



   "value":{



   "enabled":true,



   "metricKey":"uscm.sessions_by_browser_family_and_country_easytravel",



   "value":{



   "type":"COUNTER"



   },



   "dimensions":[



   "browserFamily",



   "country"



   ],



   "filters":[



   {



   "fieldName":"useraction.application",



   "operator":"EQUALS",



   "value":"www.easytravel.com"



   },



   {



   "fieldName":"userType",



   "operator":"EQUALS",



   "value":"REAL_USER"



   }



   ]



   }



   }



   ]
   ```

   The metric configuration schema identifier (`schemaId`) is `builtin:user-action-custom-metrics`.

   Here is an example JSON payload with the user action custom metric configuration:

   ```
   [



   {



   "schemaVersion":"1.0.0",



   "schemaId":"builtin:user-action-custom-metrics",



   "scope":"tenant",



   "value":{



   "enabled":true,



   "metricKey":"uacm.actions_by_type_and_country_easytravel",



   "value":{



   "type":"COUNTER"



   },



   "dimensions":[



   "type",



   "usersession.country"



   ],



   "filters":[



   {



   "fieldName":"application",



   "operator":"EQUALS",



   "value":"www.easytravel.com"



   },



   {



   "fieldName":"usersession.userType",



   "operator":"EQUALS",



   "value":"REAL_USER"



   }



   ]



   }



   }



   ]
   ```
3. Use the [POST an object](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/settings/objects/post-object "Create or validate a settings object via the Dynatrace API.") endpoint to send your configuration.

## Supported values, dimensions, and filters

Check the sections below to view the lists of supported values, dimensions, and filters for user session metric events.

Values for user session metric events

* Only user session fields are supported as a value. User action fields are not supported as a value.
* All field names must match the USQL field names.
* The `usersession.` prefix in the field name is optional. For example, `usersession.duration` and `duration` mean the same thing.
* When a configured field contains `null`, the metric is ignored, but Dynatrace uses self-monitoring to identify those cases.

#### User session fields supported as values

`duration`  
`numberOfRageClicks`

Dimensions for user session metric events

* Both user session and user action fields are supported as dimensions. User action fields are supported starting with Dynatrace version 1.234.
* All field names must match the USQL field names.
* For a user session field name, the `usersession.` prefix is optional. For example, `usersession.country` and `country` mean the same thing. When ingesting the metric, the `usersession.` prefix is dropped, for example, `usersession.country` becomes `country`.
* For a user action field name, the `useraction.` prefix is mandatory. When ingesting the metric, the `useraction.` prefix persists.
* You can add up to 10 dimensions to a single user session custom metric.
* When a field configured as a dimension contains `null`, Dynatrace uses the `null` string as a dimension value.
* When you use `useraction.application` as a dimension and a user session spans multiple applications, the value of the user session custom metric is recorded for each application. To avoid the value appearing as double-counted, split the metric by application.

Dimensions for user action metric events

* Both user session and user action fields are supported.
* All field names must match the USQL field names.
* For user action fields, the `useraction.` prefix is optional. For example, `useraction.type` and `type` mean the same thing. When ingesting the metric, the `useraction.` prefix is dropped, for example, `useraction.type` becomes `type`.
* For user session fields, the `usersession.` prefix is required. When ingesting the metric, the `usersession.` prefix persists.
* You can specify up to 4 dimensions for a user action custom metric, but only 2 of them can be high-cardinality dimensions.
* When a field configured as a dimension contains `null`, Dynatrace uses the `null` string as a dimension value.
* In the list below, dimensions in bold are high-cardinality dimensions.

Filters for user action metric events

* Both user session and user action fields are supported as filters.
* All field names must match the USQL field names.
* For user action fields, the `useraction.` prefix is optional. For example, `useraction.type` and `type` mean the same thing.
* For user session fields, the `usersession.` prefix is required.
* When you add multiple filters, all of them have to matchâfilters are combined using `AND`.
* You can set up to 10 filters for a single user action custom metric.

## Known limitations

We've identified the following limitations for USQL metric events:

* You can create up to 500 user session custom metrics per environment.
* You can create up to 100 user action custom metrics per environment.

* Synthetic user session data is not factored into values of USQL metric events; only real-user data is included.
* Dynatrace updates USQL metric events each time a session closes. This means that live session data is not factored into USQL custom metric values; only closed session data is included.
* The `DISTINCT` keyword used in [USQL](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/custom-queries-segmentation-and-aggregation-of-session-data "Learn how you can access and query user session data based on keywords, syntax, functions, and more.") is not supported. If you have a query like `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT country) from usersession`, it is not possible to create an equivalent USQL custom metric.

## Tutorial

To better understand how USQL metric events work, you can follow the tutorial for user session metric events below.

![Step 1](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-1-086e22066c.svg "Step 1")

**Create a metric**

![Step 2](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-2-1a1384627e.svg "Step 2")

**Create and pin a chart**

![Step 3](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-3-350cf6c19a.svg "Step 3")

**Create an alert**

Using the Dynatrace web UI, let's create an **Average session duration** user session custom metric (USCM) based on the session data of real users. The metric will include two dimensions for segmentation of session data by browser family and major browser version. Using this metric, we will then create a chart for the metric, pin the chart to a dashboard, and create a custom event for the metric so that you can receive alerts when the metric value exceeds a specified threshold.

Create a metric

1. Go to **Settings** > **Web and mobile monitoring** > **User session metric events**.
2. Select **Add item**.
3. Enter `uscm.average_duration_of_sessions_by_browser_family_and_version` as **Metric key**.
4. Under **Value type to be extracted**, select **User session field value**. Also, set **Field name** to `duration`.
5. Select **Add dimension**, and add the `browserMajorVersion` and `browserFamily` dimensions.
6. Under **Add a filter**, include the following filters:

   * `userType` = `REAL_USER` (**Field name** is `userType`, **Operator** is `equals`, and **Value** is `REAL_USER`)
   * `useraction.application` = `www.easytravel.com` (**Field name** is `useraction.application`, **Operator** is `equals`, and **Value** is `www.easytravel.com`). Instead of using the `www.easytravel.com` value, you can use the name of your own application.
7. Select **Save changes**.

![Creating a user session custom metric](https://dt-cdn.net/images/create-custom-metric-example-1910-e74ff5a09d.png)

Now you have a user session custom metric that is extracted as a field (`duration`) only when `useraction.application` equals `www.easytravel.com` (filtering for a specific application) and `userType` is `REAL_USER` (filtering for real users only). Additionally, you have added two dimensions that allow you to split data based on the browser family or major browser version.

Once the user session data is received and the metric is populated, you can chart this metric, pin the chart to a dashboard, and even create an alert based on the metric.

Create and pin a chart

Now let's create a chart based on the `uscm.average_duration_of_sessions_by_browser_family_and_version` metric and pin this chart to one of your dashboards.

1. Go to **Data Explorer**.
2. Select the `uscm.average_duration_of_sessions_by_browser_family_and_version` metric, and select **Run query**.

   ![Creating a chart in Data Explorer based on user sessions metric](https://dt-cdn.net/images/data-explorer-custom-metric-1221-7d8891ede4.png)
3. Using [Data Explorer](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/explorer "Query for metrics and transform results to gain desired insights."), split the collected data to see the user session data partitioned based on `browserMajorVersion`, `browserFamily`, or both.
4. Filter user session data based on `browserMajorVersion` or `browserFamily` to focus on the user session data that interests you.
5. Once you create a chart presenting your data, you can pin the chart to a classic dashboard: select **Pin to dashboard**, select one of your dashboards, and enter the tile name.

![Custom metric chart pinned to the dashboard](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboard-custom-metric-944-005355f3e5.png)

Create an alert

As the last part of this example, we'll create an alert based on the user session metric events.

To create an alert

1. Go to **Settings** > **Anomaly detection** > **Metric events**.
2. Select **Add metric event**.
3. Create a metric event based on `uscm.average_duration_of_sessions_by_browser_family_and_version` metric. For details, see [Metric events](/docs/dynatrace-intelligence/anomaly-detection/metric-events "Learn about metric events in Dynatrace").

![Creating a custom event for alerting based on a user sessions metric](https://dt-cdn.net/images/create-custom-events-for-alerting-2092-9b1d66309a.png)

## FAQ

I can see the user session data, but I don't see the USQL metric events data in Data Explorer.

Make sure the user session is not live. Dynatrace extracts and stores metric data to time series only after a user session is closed.

Why aren't the USQL metric events of live sessions shown in Data Explorer?

As sessions are closed in applications, they are pushed to the queue for later processing. A number of background workers then extract metric data from the user sessions to prepare the data for metric ingestion.

Why don't my USQL query results match the USQL metric events?

Synthetic user session data is not factored into USQL metric events.

Exclude synthetic sessions from your query. Also, check that the same timeframe is applied to the query and metric.

How are USQL metric events billed?

Starting with Dynatrace 1.232, USQL metric events are subject to the [Davis data unit (DDU) licensing](/docs/license/monitoring-consumption-classic/davis-data-units "Understand how Dynatrace monitoring consumption is calculated based on Davis data units (DDU)."). These metrics are billed as regular schemaless metrics.

To estimate the cost per metric, the sessions for the last 7 days are evaluated and the cost in DDUs per metric is calculated according to the expected ingestion per minute. For details, see [How do we calculate DDU consumption for metric events?](/docs/license/monitoring-consumption-classic/davis-data-units/metric-cost-calculation#calculation-details "Understand how to calculate Davis data unit consumption and costs related to monitored metrics.").

What's the interval granularity for USQL metric events?

The Dynatrace metric-data persistence follows a data-retention strategy that aggregates metrics over time. The data-retention strategy applied to USQL metric events is identical to the data-retention strategy used for built-in time series metrics.

For details, see [Data retention periods > Metrics](/docs/manage/data-privacy-and-security/data-privacy/data-retention-periods#metrics-classic "Check retention times for various data types.")

# Define user action and user session properties for web applications

# Define user action and user session properties for web applications

* How-to guide
* 8-min read
* Updated on Feb 12, 2026

Dynatrace captures a lot of information about the performance of your web application. You can enrich this information with valuable metadata and turn this metadata into user action and user session properties.

Action and session properties represent key-value pairs that you can filter across several Dynatrace analysis views. These properties come in handy when you need to create powerful queries, segmentations, and aggregations on the captured metadata. You can use action and session properties to create calculated application metrics. You can also see them in the multidimensional analysis view, **User sessions** page, and **User sessions query** page. To acquire a deeper understanding of how to leverage these properties, visit [Leverage user action and user session properties for web applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/action-and-session-properties "User action and session properties, which are metadata key-value pairs, provide added visibility and deeper analysis of your end users' experience. Using these properties for your web applications, you can filter user sessions, add calculated metrics, create charts, and more.").

Below you can find the information on how to configure such properties as well as related configuration examples. To exploit action and session properties, you first need to [add properties in the Dynatrace web UI](#add-properties) and then start transferring the required metadata to Dynatrace.

## Add a custom property

Use custom-defined properties to configure string, numeric, and date properties for your monitored [user actions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-actions "Learn what user actions are and how they help you understand what users do with your application.") and [user sessions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-session "Learn how a user session is defined, when a user session starts or ends, how user session duration is calculated, and more."). Dynatrace then captures property values as part of each of your users' journeys. You can leverage property values for unrivaled visibility into all the details of your users' interactions with your application. You can define custom user action and session properties that are specific to each application.

### Expression types

Dynatrace can capture metadata from the following sources (**expression types**):

* CSS selector
* JavaScript variable
* JavaScript API
* JavaScript function
* Meta tag
* Cookie value

  Requirements for Cookie value

  If you want to use `Cookie value` as a data source, ensure that the cookies don't have the `HttpOnly` attribute. Otherwise, the RUM JavaScript won't be able to read the cookie values because `HttpOnly` cookies are inaccessible to JavaScript.
* Query string
* Server-side request attribute
* XHR/fetch response header (available since RUM JavaScript version 1.253 for XHR/fetch and since RUM JavaScript version 1.257 for Angular)

  Requirements for XHR/fetch response header

  If you want to use `XHR/fetch response header` as a data source, ensure the following:

  + In your application settings, enable the **Capture fetch() requests**, **Capture XmlHttpRequest (XHR)**, or **Angular** options. For detailed instructions, see [Activate generic JavaScript frameworks support](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/configure-dynatrace-real-user-monitoring-to-capture-xhr-actions#enable-generic-js-frameworks "Understand why you need to activate specific JavaScript frameworks for XHR-action support and learn how to configure Real User Monitoring for XHR actions.") or [Activate support for Angular](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/configure-dynatrace-real-user-monitoring-to-capture-xhr-actions#enable-specific-js-frameworks "Understand why you need to activate specific JavaScript frameworks for XHR-action support and learn how to configure Real User Monitoring for XHR actions.").

    Capturing metadata from XHR/fetch response headers is not supported for AngularJS.
  + For CORS and XHR requests, Dynatrace can capture metadata only from the [CORS-safelisted response headersï»¿](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS-safelisted_response_header). If you want data to be extracted from other headers, leverage the [`Access-Control-Expose-Headers` headerï»¿](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Expose-Headers).

    - `Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Content-Encoding, Destination, Basket-value` to expose the specified headers
    - `Access-Control-Expose-Headers: *` to expose all headers except the `Authorization` header for requests without credentials
    - `Access-Control-Expose-Headers: *, Authorization` to expose all headers for requests without credentials

### Data types

Dynatrace can save the captured metadata as one of the following data types:

| Data type | Note |
| --- | --- |
| `String` | Action and session properties of the `String` data type are limited to 1,000 characters before applying the cleanup rule. |
| Number | `Double` or `Long` |
| `Date` | Only available for the `JavaScript API` [expression type](#expression-types)âmetadata should be captured via the [RUM JavaScript API](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/customize-rum "Find out how to customize Real User Monitoring using the JavaScript API."). |

### Storage types

You can save the metadata on different "storage levels".

* **User action property**: The data is stored in the defined property on the user action level for each user action where the RUM JavaScript can retrieve the metadata.
* **User session property**. The most recent captured value is stored in the defined property on a session level.
* **Both options**: The data is stored in the defined property on both the user action and session levels.

### Define a custom property

To define a custom property

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **Capturing** > **Session and action properties**.
5. Select **Add property** > **Custom-defined property**.
6. Configure the property:

   * Select an [**Expression type**](#expression-types). If applicable, also choose a [**Data type**](#data-types) and **String length**.
   * Enter the designation of the expression type you want to use, for example, the CSS selector attribute or meta tag name. For the **Server-side request attribute** type, select a [request attribute name](/docs/observe/application-observability/services/request-attributes "Understand what request attributes are and learn how to use them across all levels of all service-analysis views.").
   * Optional Define a **Display name**, which is the name of the property that is used in the Dynatrace web UI, for example, on the session details page or user action details page.
   * Specify a **Key**, which is the name of the property that is used to identify and later locate the property in [USQL](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/custom-queries-segmentation-and-aggregation-of-session-data "Learn how you can access and query user session data based on keywords, syntax, functions, and more.") and **User sessions** page.

     A **Key** that has been used in the past can't be reused [as long as the data is retained](/docs/manage/data-privacy-and-security/data-privacy/data-retention-periods "Check retention times for various data types.") in your environment. This is because the captured data still references the old property configuration.
   * Optional Turn off **Comply with "Do Not Track" browser settings** only if the property contains no personally identifiable information.

     This option is only available for certain expression types and if you've enabled the **[Comply with "Do Not Track" browser settings](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/configure-real-user-monitoring-according-to-gdpr#do-not-track-gdpr "Learn about the privacy settings that Dynatrace provides to ensure that your web applications comply with the data-privacy regulations of your region.")** in the data privacy section of your application settings.
   * Choose at least one [storage type](#storage-levels)âuser action property, session property, or both. For the session property storage type, select one of the aggregation types.
   * Optional To restrict the captured values, turn on **Apply cleanup rule**, and specify a [regular expression](/docs/manage/tags-and-metadata/reference/regular-expressions-in-dynatrace "Learn how to use regular expressions in the context of Dynatrace.").

     The regex is applied to the captured value: if you try to capture a string that is, for example, 1000 characters long, only the first 100 characters are captured, and the regex is applied to these 100 characters.

## Add a property pack

Use property packs to link analytics data to performance insights. You can do this by integrating tools, such as web analytics and performance monitoring, into Dynatrace. A host of property packs are available, for example, Adobe, Google, Intercom, and Tealeaf.

To add a property from a property pack

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **Capturing** > **Session and action properties**.
5. Select **Add property** > **Property packs**, and then choose the required property pack from the dropdown list.
6. In the **Configure properties** column, select **Add** for the properties that you want to add, and then select **Next**.
7. Choose at least one [storage type](#storage-levels)âuser action property, session property, or bothâfor each of the added properties.
8. Select **Create property**.

## Examples of action and session properties

Here are some sample definitions that work for our easyTravel test application.

* In this example, the `member_status` property captures a loyalty program membership status.

  ![User action and session properties - CSS selector example 1](https://dt-cdn.net/images/example1-2220-a488e55380.png)
* `averagepersonprice` captures the average price per person of a journey booked using our easyTravel portal.

  ![User action and session properties - CSS selector example 1](https://dt-cdn.net/images/example2-2195-bfc15d8a6d.png)
* The `author` property captures the name of the developer of the easyTravel application from a metadata tag.

  ![User action and session properties - meta tag example](https://dt-cdn.net/images/example3-2246-bef8792b1a.png)
* In the following example, a JavaScript string variable captures the userâs `appversion` during the session.

  ![User action and session properties - JavaScript variable example](https://dt-cdn.net/images/javascript-variable-1488-c376427e90.png)
* Starting with RUM JavaScript version 1.295 it is possible to extract data from JSON.
  In the following example, a JavaScript string variable captures the `userid` property of a JSON stored as a string in the `sessionStorage`.

  ![Developer Tools](https://dt-cdn.net/images/userid-devtools-2544-09723cd81f.png)

  To indicate that a string needs to be parsed as JSON, use the `$` character before the name of the property (even if the property name starts with `$`, add another `$` in front).
  In this example, the string stored in `sessionStorage.user` will be retrieved, and the `$` character indicates that the string needs to be parsed as JSON and then `userid` will be captured.

  ![Userid property](https://dt-cdn.net/images/userid-1732-1c6b552622.png)

## Use case

You can integrate Adobe Analytics with Dynatrace to facilitate collaboration among the different teams in your business. To find out how you can do this, visit [Tightening the communication within BizDevOps with Adobe Analytics & Dynatraceï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/news/blog/tightening-the-communication-within-bizdevops-with-adobe-analytics-dynatrace/) and [Actionable insights with our Adobe Analytics integration and new web propertiesï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/news/blog/actionable-insights-with-our-adobe-analytics-integration-and-new-web-properties/).

## Limitations

* You can define a maximum of 200 properties per application.
* You can define a maximum of 20 action properties per application.
* Action and session properties of the `String` data type are limited to 1,000 characters before applying the cleanup rule.
* You can use up to 20 properties per application free of charge. Additional properties consume DEM units.
  See [DEM units](/docs/license/monitoring-consumption-classic/digital-experience-monitoring-units#dem-units "Understand how Dynatrace Digital Experience Monitoring consumption is calculated based on DEM units.") (pay attention to the **Session property** and **Action property** entries in the table) and [Free tier of action and session properties](/docs/license/monitoring-consumption-classic/digital-experience-monitoring-units#free-action-and-session-properties "Understand how Dynatrace Digital Experience Monitoring consumption is calculated based on DEM units.") for more information.

## Notes

* Dynatrace begins capturing action and session properties only after you [define these properties in your application settings](#add-properties).
* Session properties aren't available for ongoing live sessions. The properties become available only after a session ends.
* The metadata is captured at the end of a user action.  
  If you want to capture the metadata at the start of a user action, select **JavaScript API** as an [expression type](#expression-types) when you [add a custom property](#add-properties), and then use the [RUM JavaScript API](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/customize-rum "Find out how to customize Real User Monitoring using the JavaScript API.") to report the required values, specifically, the [addActionPropertiesï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/doc/javascriptapi/doc/types/dtrum.html#addactionproperties) and the [sendSessionPropertiesï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/doc/javascriptapi/doc/types/dtrum.html#sendsessionproperties) methods.
* You can check how many properties you're already using and how many of them you can still add.

  1. Go to **Web**.
  2. Select the application that you want to configure.
  3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
  4. From the application settings, select **Capturing** > **Session and action properties**.
  5. Scroll down to **Property usage quotas**.

# Real User Monitoring for process groups

# Real User Monitoring for process groups

* How-to guide
* 2-min read
* Published Mar 21, 2022

By default, RUM is enabled for all process groups. For the technologies listed in [Technology support - Real User Monitoring - Web servers and applications](/docs/ingest-from/technology-support#rum-auto-injection "Find technical details related to Dynatrace support for specific platforms and development frameworks."), this allows OneAgent to do the following:

* Automatically inject the RUM JavaScript into each page delivered by this process group
* Provide the necessary information to link user actions with [server-side distributed traces](/docs/observe/application-observability/distributed-traces "Gain observability into highly distributed, cloud-native architectures to effectively trace and analyze transactions in real time.")
* Deliver the RUM JavaScript
* Forward beacons to the Dynatrace Cluster

You can disable RUM for a process group. For example, you can do that to exclude servers that do not require RUM monitoring. Furthermore, disabling RUM for a process group can serve as a workaround for resolving issues with your applications. However, we recommend that you contact a Dynatrace product expert via live chat to help you determine the root cause of the issue.

## Disable RUM for a process group

If you disable RUM for a process group, the entire RUM functionality listed above is turned off.

To manually disable RUM for a process group

1. Go to ![Technologies](https://dt-cdn.net/images/technologies-512-977161d83c.png "Technologies") **Technologies & Processes Classic**.
2. Select the technology tile that includes the process group where the RUM JavaScript is to be injected.
   The matching process groups are displayed further down the page.
3. Scroll down, and select the required process group.
4. Select **Settings** in the upper-right corner of the page.
5. In the process group settings, select **Real User Monitoring**.
6. Turn off **Enable Real User Monitoring**.

## Possible issues

* If you prefer to insert the RUM JavaScript manually, do not suppress the injection by disabling Real User Monitoring for your process groups. This suppresses not only the injection but also the linking of user actions and distributed traces. Instead, use a custom injection rule as described in [Configure automatic injection](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/rum-injection#manual-insertion-using-oneagent "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your applications").
* If your application consists of multiple tiers, enable RUM at least on OneAgent that instruments the first tier (that is the tier nearest to the browser), which captures the root of the distributed trace.  
  For example, consider an Apache HTTP server as a proxy and a Java app server as a backend. Even though Dynatrace injects the RUM JavaScript on the process group of the Java backend, disabling RUM for the process group of the Apache HTTP server would cause issues. In particular, it would be impossible to link user actions and distributed traces.

# Control the RUM JavaScript version

# Control the RUM JavaScript version

* How-to guide
* Published Jul 01, 2025

You can control which RUM JavaScript version is used for each of your web applications. Available options include at least the **Latest stable** and **Previous stable** versions. Depending on when your environment was created, additional versions for Internet Explorer may also be provided; for details, see [RUM JavaScript for Internet Explorer](#rum-javascript-for-ie). You can also configure a [custom version](#custom-version) for your environment, which will be added to the list of selectable versions.

## Configure the RUM JavaScript version for an application

To select the RUM JavaScript version

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **Injection** > **RUM JavaScript updates**.
5. Select the required RUM JavaScript version from the dropdown list.
6. Select **Save changes**.

## Set up a custom version for your environment

To set up a custom version for your environment

1. Go to **Settings** > **Web and mobile monitoring** > **Custom RUM JavaScript version**.
2. Select the required version from the dropdown.
3. Select **Save changes**.

When you configure the RUM JavaScript version as described in [Configure the RUM JavaScript version for an application](#configure-js-version), a custom version option will now show up in the dropdown list.

## RUM JavaScript for Internet Explorer

* We ended support for Internet Explorer 7â10 starting with RUM JavaScript version 1.265.
* We ended support for Internet Explorer 11 starting with RUM JavaScript version 1.293.

As a result, starting with these versions, the RUM JavaScript can't initialize on these browsers and, therefore, can't send any RUM data to Dynatrace. The browser console will show a message stating that the RUM JavaScript is disabled or that the browser can't parse the RUM JavaScript.

Depending on when your environment was created, specific RUM JavaScript versions are available that ensure compatibility with Internet Explorer 7â10 and Internet Explorer 11, respectively.

RUM JavaScript version 1.263 is the last version that is compatible with Internet Explorer 7â10, and RUM JavaScript version 1.291 is the last version that is compatible with Internet Explorer 11. These versions are provided as is and will not receive any more updates.

### Internet Explorer 7â10

* **Environments created in Dynatrace version 1.266+**: You can't use the RUM JavaScript version that is compatible with Internet Explorer 7â10.
* **Environments created before Dynatrace version 1.266**: You can choose a version of the RUM JavaScript that is compatible with Internet Explorer 7â10. Select the **Latest IE7-10 supported** option in step 5 of the instructions in [Configure the RUM JavaScript version for an application](#configure-js-version).

### Internet Explorer 11

* **Environments created in Dynatrace version 1.294+**: You can't use the RUM JavaScript version that is compatible with Internet Explorer 11.
* **Environments created before Dynatrace version 1.294**: You can choose a version of the RUM JavaScript that is compatible with Internet Explorer 11. Select the **Latest IE11 supported** option in step 5 of the instructions in [Configure the RUM JavaScript version for an application](#configure-js-version).

### Internet Explorer 11 with Compatibility View

If your application might be viewed via Internet Explorer 11 with Compatibility View enabled, use the **Latest IE7-10 supported** version, not the **Latest IE11 supported** version. If you choose the **Latest IE11 supported** version, the RUM JavaScript won't initialize, and the browser console will display the following message:

```
Unsupported Internet Explorer version detected. Only version 11 (without Compatibility View) is supported!
```

# Leverage user action and user session properties for web applications

# Leverage user action and user session properties for web applications

* How-to guide
* 3-min read
* Published Jan 27, 2022

User action properties and user session properties provide a powerful and flexible means of adding information to each user action and user session. You can leverage these properties for deeper visibility into all the details of your users' interactions with your application.

Action and session properties are metadata key-value pairs that are derived from captured data. This metadata is "promoted" from request attributes, CSS selector attributes, meta tags, and more. Action and session properties come in handy when you need to create powerful queries, segmentations, or aggregations on captured metadata. You can use action and session properties to create calculated application metrics. You can also view these properties on the multidimensional analysis page, the **User sessions** page, and the **User sessions query** page.

See the sections below to learn where you can find the values that are captured as custom user action and session properties and how you can take full advantage of these properties.

Before you can leverage user action and session properties, you need to define these properties in your application settings. For details, see [Define user action and user session properties for web applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/define-user-action-and-session-properties "Define custom string, numeric, and date properties for your monitored web applications.").

## User session analysis

The **[User sessions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/new-user-sessions "Learn about user session segmentation and filtering attributes.")** page offers the option to filter user sessions by action and session properties. For example, if you're running a loyalty program, you can add a `loyalty_status` property to learn whether a user in a monitored user session is a `Silver`, `Gold`, or `Platinum` member. You can then filter for `Platinum` or `Gold` customers on the **User sessions** page.

1. Go to ![Session Segmentation](https://dt-cdn.net/images/session-segmentation-512-5278e8fa16.png "Session Segmentation") **Session Segmentation**.
2. In **Filter by**, select one of the property types, for example, **Session date properties** or **User action string properties**, and then choose the required property.
3. Select the property value or values according to your needs.
4. Select a session to view its details and the available session properties.
5. From the user session details page you can drill down into user actions. Expand a user action, and then select **Perform waterfall analysis**. From this page, you can check the available action properties as well as all reported values.

   ![User action analysis](https://dt-cdn.net/images/user-action-analysis-1639-89f7ffac81.png)
6. In the upper-right corner, select **Analyze user action** to dive even deeper. Under **User action properties**, select the action property for further analysis.

## Additional insights with USQL

User action and session properties can greatly improve your analytics capabilities when using the [Dynatrace User Sessions Query Language (USQL)](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/custom-queries-segmentation-and-aggregation-of-session-data "Learn how you can access and query user session data based on keywords, syntax, functions, and more.") for analytics that require advanced filtering or persistent filtering across analysis views. Also, when you want to keep track of the monetary values and conversion goals that are key to the success of your business, you can construct queries based on the unique values of the individual user action or session properties that have been defined for your environment.

To use action and session properties in USQL

1. Go to ![Query user sessions](https://dt-cdn.net/images/query-user-sessions-512-77c5a8da9f.png "Query user sessions") **Query User Sessions**.
2. Enter the required query. The following custom properties are available:

   | Custom property | Table | Action property | Session property |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | `<dataType>Properties.<propertyKey>` | `useraction` | Applicable |  |
   | `<dataType>Properties.<propertyKey>` | `usersession` |  | Applicable |
   | `useraction.<dataType>Properties.<propertyKey>` | `useraction` | Applicable |  |
   | `useraction.<dataType>Properties.<propertyKey>` | `usersession` | Applicable |  |
   | `usersession.<dataType>Properties.<propertyKey>` | `useraction` |  | Applicable |
   | `usersession.<dataType>Properties.<propertyKey>)` | `usersession` |  | Applicable |

   The `<dataType>` part can take the following values:

   * `string`
   * `long`
   * `double`
   * `date`
3. Select **Run query**.

In the example below, you can see how many request errors the Silver, Gold, and Platinum customers have faced.

```
SELECT stringProperties.loyalty_status AS "Loyalty status", COUNT(useraction.requestErrorCount) AS "HTTP error count" FROM usersession WHERE stringProperties.loyalty_status IS NOT NULL GROUP BY stringProperties.loyalty_status
```

![Gain additional insights with USQL](https://dt-cdn.net/images/use-properties-usql-1642-60372d3301.png)

## Integration via User session API

The [User sessions API](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/user-sessions "Learn what the Dynatrace User Sessions Query language API offers."), in combination with our [User Sessions Query Language (USQL)](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/custom-queries-segmentation-and-aggregation-of-session-data "Learn how you can access and query user session data based on keywords, syntax, functions, and more."), enables you to access all user action and session data, including properties and values.

Extending the loyalty program example above, you can leverage the problem information and loyalty status information via the User session API by querying the user sessions that were impacted by the problem after the problem was closed. This allows you to use the information to, for example, set up personalized marketing campaigns.

Here are some sample queries you may want to leverage:

* Gold member user sessions on an application within a certain timeframeâyou can leverage this for problems that impact an entire application.

  ```
  SELECT userId, stringProperties.loyalty_status FROM usersession WHERE stringProperties.loyalty_status = "Gold" AND userType = "REAL_USER" AND useraction.application = "easyTravel" AND startTime > 1531741985241 AND endTime < 1531932305287
  ```
* Platinum member users on a specific application hitting a specific page within a certain timeframeâyou can leverage this for problems that impact a specific page.

  ```
  SELECT userId, stringProperties.loyalty_status, useraction.targetUrl FROM usersession WHERE stringProperties.loyalty_status = "Platinum" AND userType = "REAL_USER" AND useraction.application = "easyTravel" AND startTime > 1531741985241 AND endTime < 1531932305287 AND useraction.targetUrl = "https://easytravel.perform-2018.dynalabs.io/special-offers.jsp"
  ```

## Dashboards

For web, mobile, and custom applications, you can [create a query](#usql) with action and session properties and then pin the resulting chart to one of your dashboards.

For web applications, you can additionally create calculated metrics based on custom properties, use these metrics to create a chart and then pin this chart to your dashboards. This can be done in [Data Explorer](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/explorer "Query for metrics and transform results to gain desired insights.").

The generic **Web property pack** is used in the following example to track the marketing campaigns on [Dynatrace.comï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/) to view the following:

* Overall traffic by continent
* Top campaigns by continent
* Slowest landing experience by marketing campaign

![Web property pack](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dynatrace-com-marketing-campaigns-anonym-1600x951-1600-59971b5148.png)

## Session properties export

You can export captured user session properties, along with all other user session data, within user session export streams.

For more details, see [Export user sessions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation/export-session-data "Set up Dynatrace to export user session data to a provided webhook endpoint.").

## Multidimensional analysis

You can also leverage custom properties in [Multidimensional analysis](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/multi-dimensional-analysis "Find out how Dynatrace Real User Monitoring enables you to dig deep into your user actions and perform analysis across numerous dimensions."). For instance, you can analyze user actions based on your custom properties or you can filter data by property values.

To use custom properties on the **Multidimensional analysis** page

1. Go to **Web** and select your application.
2. Under **Impact of user actions on performance**, select **Analyze performance**.
3. Scroll down to **Detail analysis for selected timeframe**, and select the required custom property in **Analyze by**.

   ![Using custom properties on the Multidimensional analysis page](https://dt-cdn.net/images/use-properties-mda-2-2134-eb53554356.png)
4. Optional In **Filter by**, set the required filters. For example, you can filter by user action properties.

   ![Filtering by property on the Multidimensional analysis page](https://dt-cdn.net/images/mda-filter-by-properties-2132-bc8eab93c3.png)
5. Scroll down to see more details. You can use the additional property values for further insight into your application's performance and success.

## Calculated metrics, charts, and alerts

To extend usefulness, create a [calculated metric](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/rum-calculated-metrics-web "Create calculated metrics as well as custom charts based on calculated metrics for your web applications.") with your user action properties. You can create a metric either from the [**Multidimensional analysis** page](#mda) or from your application settings. After you add a metric, you can use it to create custom charts and alerts.

To create a metric from the **Multidimensional analysis** page

1. From the **Multidimensional analysis** page, scroll down to **Detail analysis for selected timeframe**, and set the required options in **Analyze by** and, if required, in **Filter by**.
2. Select **Create metric**.
3. Optional Change the metric name and metric key.

   ![Creating a calculated metric with data filtered by action property](https://dt-cdn.net/images/creating-calculated-metric-with-data-filtered-by-action-property-2134-e9027de910.png)
4. Select **Create metric** to save the metric.
5. Optional Select **Create a chart** or **Create alert**. For details, see [Data Explorer](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/explorer "Query for metrics and transform results to gain desired insights.") and [Metric events](/docs/dynatrace-intelligence/anomaly-detection/metric-events "Learn about metric events in Dynatrace").

To create a metric from your web application settings

* Explanation
* 2-min read
* Published Jul 11, 2019

The application overview page, which is organized into meaningful and intuitive sections, allows you to perform a thorough analysis of both the performance of your application as well as the user behavior.

To access the application overview page

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select an application.

## Filtering

You can perform your analysis based on a specific dimension selected from the filter at the top of the application overview page. If you choose **User type** for example, you can specify whether you want to perform your analysis based on data gathered from **Synthetic**, **Real users**, or **Robots**.

## Tags and JavaScript frameworks

Right beneath the name of your application, you can view the assigned [tags](/docs/manage/tags-and-metadata "Learn how to define tags and metadata. Understand how to use tags and metadata to organize your environment.") and [JavaScript frameworks](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/configure-dynatrace-real-user-monitoring-to-capture-xhr-actions "Understand why you need to activate specific JavaScript frameworks for XHR-action support and learn how to configure Real User Monitoring for XHR actions."), which are displayed within the expandable **Tags and JavaScript frameworks** area. It's easy to add new tags hereâjust select **Add tag**. There's also a **Framework settings** button that takes you to the settings related to [JavaScript frameworks](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/configure-dynatrace-real-user-monitoring-to-capture-xhr-actions "Understand why you need to activate specific JavaScript frameworks for XHR-action support and learn how to configure Real User Monitoring for XHR actions.").

# Multidimensional analysis for web applications

# Multidimensional analysis for web applications

* How-to guide
* 8-min read
* Published Jun 28, 2019

Dynatrace Real User Monitoring enables you to dig deep into your [user actions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-actions "Learn what user actions are and how they help you understand what users do with your application.") and perform analysis across numerous dimensions. Multidimensional **User action analysis** pages can be accessed from many entry points throughout Dynatrace. Depending on where you begin your analysis, pre-selected filters can be applied and carried forward as your analysis progresses.

Following are the main entry scenarios for making use of the latest multidimensional **User action analysis** views.

Scenario 1: Analysis based on user action type

Dynatrace differentiates between **Load actions**, **XHR actions**, and **Custom actions** (see below), enabling you to apply the ideal performance metrics for each action type. This provides for focused, in-context analysis of each user action type.

To access multidimensional analysis based on user action type

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application you want to analyze.
3. In the **Impact of user actions on performance** section of the page, select **Analyze Performance** to open the **User action analysis** view.

   ![Multidimensional analysis](https://dt-cdn.net/images/application-overview-screen-key-performance-filter1-1066-39375d615b.png)

   The upper section of the multidimensional **User action analysis** page provides primary filtering options you can use to focus analysis on specific user action types.
4. From the filter lists at the top of the page, select relevant values for filtering based on **Action type**, **User type**, **Performance metric**, and **Contribution** (see image below).
5. Select a duration for the analysis timeframe from the **Analyze user actions during the pastâ¦** drop list.
6. Select the timeline chart to select the timeframe you want to analyze. The lower section of the view shows the more detailed, multi-dimensional user action analytics view with all the primary filters applied.

![Multi-dimensional analysis](https://dt-cdn.net/images/multi-dimensional-primary-grouping-filter-and-metric-selsection-1600-15378e6362.png)

7. Optional Select **Filtered by** to add additional filters. Filters are available for action duration, Apdex, JavaScript errors, user type, browser, location and more. Further down youâll see a list of all the **Key user actions** that meet your filter criteria, along with the **Top 100 user actions** (this list is initially based on total time consumed, but you can also filter based on JavaScript errors, action count, or duration.

![Multi-dimensional analysis](https://dt-cdn.net/images/multi-dimensional-analytics-screen-analytics-section1-870-aac5976141.png)

8. Select the user action you want to investigate more deeply. This takes you to the **User actions view** of the selected user action (Loading of page `/special-offers.jsp` in the example below). As you can see, the defined filters and analysis time frame are applied to the analysis on this page.

   ![Multi-dimensional analysis](https://dt-cdn.net/images/specific-user-action-with-filters-applied-from-multi-dimensional-user-action-analytics1-1600-e9ba1dc253.png)

   The applied filters and analysis timeframe are even carried over to the [**Waterfall analysis view**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/waterfall-analysis "Learn how to analyze all user action monitoring data through waterfall analysis.") (see below).

   ![Multi-dimensional analysis](https://dt-cdn.net/images/specific-waterfall-for-user-action-with-filters-applied-from-multi-dimensional-user-action-analytics-screen3-1600-bc8c0f6bd6.png)

Scenario 2: Analysis based on browser type

Sometimes you need to figure out if users that share the same browser type are facing the same performance issues.

To access multidimensional analysis based on browser type

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application you want to analyze.
3. Within the **Performance analysis** infographic, select the **Top browser** tile in the upper-left corner to display the **Browser breakdown** section.
4. Select **Analyze performance** at the bottom of the section.

   ![Multi-dimensional analysis](https://dt-cdn.net/images/1-application-overview-with-top-browser-insights-break-down-1600-f554e6b3c2.png)

   This takes you to the **Multidimensional analysis** view, where the analysis mode is set to **Browsers** (see below).
5. From the filter lists at the top of the page, select relevant values for filtering based on **Action type**, **User / browser type**, **Performance metric**, and **Contribution**.

   ![Multi-dimensional analysis](https://dt-cdn.net/images/browser-breakdown-entry-to-multi-dimensional-user-analytics-screen-1599-5e523dfa54.png)
6. Select a duration from the analysis time range drop list.
7. Select the timeline chart to select the timeframe you want to analyze. From here, you can pinpoint and analyze only those user actions you they relevant to your analysis.

Scenario 3: Analysis based on user type

Sometimes you want to learn more about the bots that crawl your website, perhaps because your company is working toward Search Engine Optimization (SEO), or you just want to see a âclean room requestâ made via Synthetic monitoring.

To access multidimensional analysis based on user type

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application you want to analyze.
3. Within the **Performance analysis** infographic, select the **Top user type** tile in the upper-left corner to display the User type section.
4. Select the **Analyze performance** at the bottom of the section.

   ![Multi-dimensional analysis](https://dt-cdn.net/images/0-application-overview-with-user-type-break-down-1600-652da6c2f1.png)

   This takes you to multi-dimensional **User action analysis** view, which highlights the different user types that have performed the user actions under analysis. The **Analyze by** list in the **Multidimensional analysis** section is preset to **Browsers**.
5. From the filter lists at the top of the page, select relevant values for filtering based on **Action type**, **Performance metric**, and **Contribution**.

   ![Multi-dimensional analysis](https://dt-cdn.net/images/user-type-breakdown-entry-to-multi-dimensional-user-analytics-screen-1599-f2e40b76ae.png)
6. Select a duration from the analysis timeframe range drop list.
7. Select the timeline chart to select the timeframe you want to analyze. From here, you can pinpoint and analyze only those user actions that youâre most interested in.

Scenario 4: Analysis based on geolocation

In this scenario, the focus is on finding user actions from a specific geographic region. Letâs say youâve added a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for a certain region and want insights into how well the new CDN is working.

To access multidimensional analysis based on geolocation

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application you want to analyze.
3. Within the **Performance analysis** infographic, select the **View geolocation breakdown** tile in the lower-left corner to display the **Geolocation breakdown** section.
4. Select **Analyze performance** at the bottom of the section.

   ![Multi-dimensional analysis](https://dt-cdn.net/images/2-application-overview-with-geo-location-break-down-1600-945b822f7e.png)

   This takes you to multidimensional **User action analysis** view, which now shows the top geolocations where your user actions originate from.
5. From the filter lists at the top of the page, select relevant values for filtering based on **Action type**, **User type**, **Performance metric**, and **Contribution**.

![Multi-dimensional analysis](https://dt-cdn.net/images/geo-location-breakdown-entry-to-multi-dimensional-user-analytics-screen-1599-7d2031e084.png)

6. Select a duration from the analysis time range drop list.
7. Select the timeline chart to select the timeframe you want to analyze. From here, you can pinpoint and analyze only those user actions that are relevant to your analysis.

Scenario 5: Analysis based on error type

![Multidimensional analysis](https://dt-cdn.net/images/multidimensional-analysis-5007-e664cf92d9.png)

For web applications, Dynatrace classifies [errors](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#error "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace.") as **Request**, **Custom**, and **JavaScript** errors, allowing you to apply filters and analyze them categorically. You can therefore conduct a focused and contextual analysis of each type of error detected within a selected timeframe

To access multidimensional analysis based on errors

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application you want to analyze.
3. In the **Performance analysis** infographic, select the **Errors by type** tile at the lower-left corner to view the top **Request**, **Custom**, and **JavaScript** errors.
4. Select **Analyze errors** to go to the **Multidimensional analysis: Errors** page.
5. Apply filters to view specific errors in the selected timeframe by selecting them from the following list boxes:

   * **Error type**: `Request`, `Custom`, and `JavaScript`
   * **Context**: `Errors during user actions` and `Errors between user actions`
   * **Origin**: `1st party errors`, `3rd party errors`, and `CDN errors`
6. Select **Show your errors** by `Type`, `Context`, or `Origin`.
7. Select a time duration from the analysis range list box.
8. Select the timeline chart to select the timeframe and slide along the timeline to select the range you want to analyze. From here, you can narrow down and analyze only the errors that are relevant to your analysis.
9. Optional Select the respective error type in the legend to hide or show the respective error type in the chart.

![Error analysis](https://dt-cdn.net/images/error-analysis-2757-13832acb4e.png)

After using the **Overview** to identify an accumulation of errors, you can also use the **Detail analysis** card for the selected timeframe to further analyze the errors.

1. Select one of the following dimensions by which you want to analyze the timeframe:

   * **Performance over time**
   * **Distribution**
   * **Browsers**
   * **Geolocation**
   * **Errors**
2. Select the option to group the errors by `Type`, `Context`, or `Origin`.
3. Optional Apply a filter by selecting the input field and choosing a desired filter. Use **Enter** and provide a corresponding filter value.

![Analysis by error type](https://dt-cdn.net/images/error-analysis-1873-78a0287859.png)

In this example, we find that we had an `HTTP 500` error on a booking API, which we now want to inspect. When you select this error, the error detail page displays the most basic information related to the error, such as:

* How often the error occurred
* The number of sessions and users that were impacted
* The elements, such as user actions, OS, browser types, and locations that were involved in the error

In the error detail card, you can find additional error information, such as whether the error was detected by the RUM JavaScript or by OneAgent. When you select **Edit detection rules for this error pattern**, you are directed to the page where you can edit the web request error pattern that detected the error. Alternatively, you can select **Create detection rule based on this error pattern** to create an explicit web request error rule for the detected request error.

![Error details](https://dt-cdn.net/images/error-details-5093-27df9761b5.png)

To further investigate the error you can conduct an in-depth session analysis of one of the affected sessions listed under **User sessions affected by the error** to find out more about where and how the error occurred. Features such as [Session Replay](/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-replay "Learn how you can use Session Replay to better understand and troubleshoot errors experienced by your customers.") make it easy to find and communicate the errors of these users throughout your organization.

![User details page](https://dt-cdn.net/images/user-sessions-to-user-details-page-1637-f01f4b8bf0.png)

![Session replay](https://dt-cdn.net/images/session-replay-1917-70e8439a06.png)

Another way to further investigate an error is to look at it from the user action perspective. Use a filter on a certain error found in the **Detail analysis** for the selected timeframe card to refine the errors of interest, and then scroll down to **Key user actions** or **Top 100 user actions** to find related user actions. Select a user action of interest, and select it to analyze individual user actions.

![Analyze errors by user action](https://dt-cdn.net/images/analyze-errors-by-user-action-2880-b1252314fe.png)

As as example, the following page shows that errors can be integrated into a waterfall analysis as either a bar or a marker at the time where an error occurs.

The **Performance analysis** section displays a number of performance metrics for your application. Just expand the **Performance analysis** section of the infographic on the [application overview page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/introduction-to-application-overview "Read an overview of the analysis options offered on the application overview page.") to view the performance analysis options.

![Performance analysis](https://dt-cdn.net/images/performance-analysis-2346-018950fbc4.png)

## Working with the infographic

Each area of the infographic appearing at the top is clickable, offering access to deeper detail regarding each metric. Whenever you select a part of the infographic, the left section right below the infographic shows different data that reflect the selected part.

The left-hand portion of the performance analysis infographic shows dimensional breakdowns of your application traffic based on browser type, user type, and geographic region. In the middle, you can see the different action types, the Apdex rating and the errors section, while on the right-hand side, the resources and the services sections are displayed. The top finding for each dimension is displayed by default in each section. The discrete infographic sections are briefly described below.

Top browsers

If you select the **Top browser** section of the infographic, you see the **Browser breakdown** on the left under the infographic. This shows the traffic per desktop browser, mobile browser, [synthetic](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring "Learn about Synthetic Monitoring and how to create a single-URL browser monitor, a browser clickpath, or an HTTP monitor."), and more.

By selecting **Analyze performance** in the bottom right corner of the **Browser breakdown** section, you navigate to the [multidimensional analysis page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/multi-dimensional-analysis "Find out how Dynatrace Real User Monitoring enables you to dig deep into your user actions and perform analysis across numerous dimensions."), where you can perform a multidimensional analysis from the **Browsers** perspective.

![Browsers](https://dt-cdn.net/images/browsers-2278-df044b9e0a.png)

Top user type

By selecting **Top user type**, in the **User type** section under the infographic, you can see the number of actions per minute, Load and XHR actions, and JavaScript errors of **Real users** versus **Robots** (for example, Googlebot), and [**Synthetic**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring "Learn about Synthetic Monitoring and how to create a single-URL browser monitor, a browser clickpath, or an HTTP monitor."). The bar appearing at the top of the **User type** section, is a visual representation of this breakdown.

By selecting **Analyze performance** in the bottom right corner of the **Browser breakdown** section, you navigate to the [multidimensional analysis page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/multi-dimensional-analysis "Find out how Dynatrace Real User Monitoring enables you to dig deep into your user actions and perform analysis across numerous dimensions."), where you can perform a multidimensional analysis from the **User type** perspective.

![User types](https://dt-cdn.net/images/user-types-2289-a96765e8cd.png)

Geolocation breakdown

By selecting **Geolocation breakdown** you can view the geographical locations that have the highest traffic. You can view further details on the [world map](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/world-map-view "Learn how the World map view offers insights into Apdex ratings, user actions, action durations, and JavaScript errors.") that you can access by selecting **View full world map**.

By selecting **Analyze performance** in the bottom right corner of this section, you navigate to the [multidimensional analysis page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/multi-dimensional-analysis "Find out how Dynatrace Real User Monitoring enables you to dig deep into your user actions and perform analysis across numerous dimensions."), where you can perform a multidimensional analysis from the **Geolocations** perspective.

![Geolocations](https://dt-cdn.net/images/geolocations-2335-e51f88186e.png)

Load, XHR, and custom user actions

[User actions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-actions "Learn what user actions are and how they help you understand what users do with your application.") are divided into **Load** actions and **XHR** actions (or custom actions if available).

If you select the user actions part of the infographic, you can view the **Impact of user actions on performance**. The charts displayed show among other things, the [Visually complete](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-action-metrics "Learn what metrics Dynatrace calculates for user actions and find out what each metric indicates.") metric for load actions and the [Response end](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-action-metrics "Learn what metrics Dynatrace calculates for user actions and find out what each metric indicates.") for XHR actions.

You can also use the metric selector to display either the **Slowest 10%**, **Median**, or **Fastest 10%** of user actions.

By selecting **Analyze performance** in the bottom right corner of this section, you can [analyze your applicationâs performance and user actions across multiple dimensions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/multi-dimensional-analysis "Find out how Dynatrace Real User Monitoring enables you to dig deep into your user actions and perform analysis across numerous dimensions.").

![Performance analysis](https://dt-cdn.net/images/performance-analysis-marked-2346-a63d69b1ca.png)

Apdex rating

Dynatrace relies on [Apdex ratings](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/scores-and-ratings/apdex-ratings "Learn how Dynatrace uses Apdex to measure user satisfaction with application performance.") to calculate user satisfaction with specific applications. By selecting **Apdex rating**, you can view the user satisfaction within the specified time frame.

![Apdex](https://dt-cdn.net/images/apdex-2275-4f37729a71.png)

Resources

Select **Resources** in the infographic to view details regarding the resources that your application relies on. Dynatrace uses the provider host names of downloaded resources to categorize content resources into either **3rd party resources**, **CDN resources**, or **1st party resources**. You can examine the action duration by resource type and also compare it to a previous time frame.

In the **1st party resources** tab, you can also look for trends in your internal resourcesâ**Scripts**, **Images**, and **CSS** resources are tracked and reported separately.

From this section, you can also navigate to the [provider detection settings](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/configure-third-party-and-cdn-content-detection-web "Manually define third-party and CDN providers along with auto-detected providers for your web applications.") where you can manually add a provider.

![Resources](https://dt-cdn.net/images/resources-2279-8542dfb13e.png)

Dynatrace allows you to [access the service flow for an application as well as a user action](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/service-flows-for-applications-and-user-actions "Learn how to access service flows for applications and user actions.").

![Services](https://dt-cdn.net/images/services-2255-23e1ba2133.png)

### Application availability

If you have one or more [synthetic monitors](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/define-your-applications-via-the-my-web-application-placeholder "Learn how to define your applications following the suggested, manual, or application detection rules approach.") set up to test the availability of your application, you can see the availability of your application directly on the application overview page within the **Availability** section. The availability chart shows you an aggregate view of all of the selected application's synthetic monitors. You can select **View full details** to view details related to outages and navigate directly to synthetic monitor details (your [analysis timeframe](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/dashboards-classic/dashboards/dashboard-timeframe "Learn about Dynatrace dashboard timeframe and management zone settings.") settings will remain intact) to perform further analysis.

![Availability](https://dt-cdn.net/images/availability-2274-52399f442d.png)

## Composite metrics across response times

This section helps you figure out from a high level perspective where your performance focus should lie. You can identify, for example, whether the duration up to the time to first byte is an issue for your application or you should focus on user perceived loading performance, indicated by Speed index and Visually complete.

If you select **Analyze performance** in the bottom right corner of this section, you can [analyze your applicationâs performance and user actions across multiple dimensions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/multi-dimensional-analysis "Find out how Dynatrace Real User Monitoring enables you to dig deep into your user actions and perform analysis across numerous dimensions.").

![Composite metrics](https://dt-cdn.net/images/metrics-2309-defde297c9.png)

## Top 3 included domains

At a glance, you can see the **Top 3 included domains**, which are the domains that contain the largest number of actions that have been automatically detected by [OneAgent](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-oneagent "Understand the important concepts related to OneAgent and find out how to install and operate OneAgent on different platforms.") in your environment. You can select **View full details** to view more details on the traffic coming from these domains and to [define new applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/define-your-applications-via-the-my-web-application-placeholder "Learn how to define your applications following the suggested, manual, or application detection rules approach.").

![Domains](https://dt-cdn.net/images/domains-2296-117bbe4967.png)

## Problems

The [Problems](/docs/dynatrace-intelligence "Get familiar with the capabilities of Dynatrace Intelligence.") section indicates problems that have been automatically detected by Davis, the Dynatrace AI engine. Just select a problem to learn further details.

![Problems](https://dt-cdn.net/images/problems-2300-47780cd400.png)

## Top errors

The **Top errors** list displays the most frequently occurring [errors](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-and-error-events#error "Learn about user and error events and the types of user and error events captured by Dynatrace.") by error type: **JavaScript**, **Request**, or **Custom**. You can [configure errors](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/configure-errors "Configure your application to capture or ignore request, custom, and JavaScript errors.") by type or individually.

To view **Top errors**

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to analyze and scroll down to **Top errors**.

![Top errors infographic](https://dt-cdn.net/images/top-errors-921-5efd41aa51.png)

## Top 3 user actions

The **Top 3 user actions** list shows you the three slowest user actions. Actions are sorted based on **priority** (high priority actions are listed first) and **total time consumed** (duration multiplied by number of actions). The **total time consumed** measure is valuable because it factors in how frequently an action is called. For example, a slow action that is called often has more significant impact on performance than a slow action that isn't called often.

If you select a user action, you'll be directed to the [user action overview page](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/analyze-individual-user-actions "Understand how you can access user action detail pages and analyze user actions.") where you can further analyze the specific user action.

If you select **View full details** in the bottom right corner of the section, you can [analyze your applicationâs performance and user actions across multiple dimensions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/multi-dimensional-analysis "Find out how Dynatrace Real User Monitoring enables you to dig deep into your user actions and perform analysis across numerous dimensions.").

![User actions](https://dt-cdn.net/images/user-actions-2260-8e1d88bb09.png)

## Events

Events represent system incidents that might be of interest to you. Such events include errors, new version deployments of your application, configuration changes, and more. The events shown in the image below were generated because the [maximum number of user actions per minute was exceededï»¿](https://dt-url.net/h92389d).

# Check your application health

# Check your application health

* How-to guide
* 4-min read
* Updated on Mar 20, 2024

Dynatrace offers a dedicated page where you can check the health of your web application.

The **Application health check** page provides information on the most common issues that might affect your web application. On this page, you can check the health of your application, see which RUM JavaScript versions are currently in use, or confirm that the RUM JavaScript is injected correctly. Examining this page should be the first step in troubleshooting any RUM issues when the data is partially or completely missing.

To access the **Application health check** page

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application whose health you want to check.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Health check**.

The following sections are available on the **Application health check** page:

[**RUM JavaScript version distribution**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/app-health-check#rum-js-version "The Application health check page allows you to analyze the health of your application, see which RUM JavaScript versions are currently in use, or confirm that the RUM JavaScript is injected correctly.")[**RUM status**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/app-health-check#rum-status "The Application health check page allows you to analyze the health of your application, see which RUM JavaScript versions are currently in use, or confirm that the RUM JavaScript is injected correctly.")[**RUM JavaScript injection diagnostic**s](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/app-health-check#injection-diagnostics "The Application health check page allows you to analyze the health of your application, see which RUM JavaScript versions are currently in use, or confirm that the RUM JavaScript is injected correctly.")

![Application health check page](https://dt-cdn.net/images/app-health-check-3030-5a500c4f25.png)

## RUM JavaScript version distribution

In this section, you can learn which RUM JavaScript version is the most frequently used in your application and check the RUM JavaScript version distribution.

Select **Show more** to view a table showing the number of requestsâin the last 30 days and 24 hoursâfor each detected RUM JavaScript version.

This section also shows for which RUM JavaScript versions the RUM data is discarded. To receive RUM data, update the RUM JavaScript to a later version than indicated in this section.

## RUM status

In the **RUM status** section, you can see if RUM is activated for your application, related process groups, and hosts. Moreover, this section explains why Dynatrace doesn't capture RUM data for certain user sessions.

The following configuration-related RUM issues and warnings might be shown in this section:

Issue or warning

If you want to ignore the "Do Not Track" browser setting and capture RUM data from all browsers, disable the Do Not Track mode. Alternatively, you can select the **Capture anonymous user sessions for "Do Not Track"-enabled browsers** option to send anonymized data from such browsers.

## RUM JavaScript injection diagnostics

Examine this section to get information on the RUM JavaScript injection status. You can check the number of injection attempts, learn the ratio of failed to successful injections, and view the injection failure reasons.

Select **Run injection diagnostics** to check the RUM JavaScript injection status.

When a diagnostics run is finished, the following information is available:

* Number of injection attempts
* List of target processes
* Number and percentage of failed injections
* Number and percentage of successful injections

Select **Show more** to view the injection failure reasons and the top five URLs for each issue.

You won't see the **RUM JavaScript injection diagnostics** section if your application is not an automatically injected applicationâspecifically, if you [manually inserted the RUM JavaScript](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/set-up-agentless-real-user-monitoring "Set up agentless monitoring for your web applications.") into your application's pages.

# Define applications for Real User Monitoring

# Define applications for Real User Monitoring

* How-to guide
* 14-min read
* Updated on Apr 23, 2024

After [OneAgent](/docs/ingest-from/dynatrace-oneagent "Understand the important concepts related to OneAgent and find out how to install and operate OneAgent on different platforms.") in full-stack monitoring mode is installed on a host, it monitors all applications running on that host. As a starting point, all monitoring data is encapsulated in a placeholder application called **My web application**. We offer this placeholder application to allow for more flexibilityâit's you who decides how to organize your applications.

Dynatrace offers the following approaches to defining your application for RUM.

| Application detection approach | RUM JavaScript injection type | When to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Suggested approach](#automated-approach) | Auto-injection | When your web applications can be easily identified based on domains and you want to create an application from already captured RUM monitoring traffic. |
| [Application detection rules approach](#application-detection-rules) | Auto-injection | When you want to create new applications or when dividing your traffic based on domains isn't sufficient. Use application detection rules to define more complex patterns to group your RUM monitoring traffic into applications. |
| [Manual approach](#alternative-approach) (aka "agentless monitoring") | Manual insertion | When you don't have access to the host of your web application, but you have access to the application code. |

You can choose the injection format for both auto-injected and manually inserted applications. For details, see [Select a snippet format](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case").

Java Servletâbased applications

If you're using RUM for a Java Servletâbased application, make sure to restart the process after you finish the initial setup. The RUM sensor isn't enabled until after the restart.

## Suggested approach

The **My web application** placeholder application aggregates the traffic from all detected domains. This application can serve as your starting point for mapping the identified domains to separate applications in your environment.

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the **My web application** placeholder application.
3. Scroll down to find the **Top 3 included domains** panel.  
   This panel shows the domains with the largest number of user actions that OneAgent detected in your environment.
4. Select **View full details**.
5. In the **Top domains** list, select the arrow button in the **Transfer domain** column to expand a domain entry.
6. Follow one of the options below:

   * To add a new application, select **Create new application**. Your application is created and listed on the **Applications** page.
   * To add the domain to an existing application, select **Transfer**.

As you may want a more meaningful name for your application, replace the auto-generated name with a custom application name of your choosing.

To rename an application

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **General settings** > **Application name**.
5. Type in the name you prefer in the box at the top of the page. Note that application names must be unique.

### Possible issues for the suggested approach

**Uninstrumented component rewrites the URL**. When you follow the suggested approach, an application detection rule is automatically created for your new or updated application. This rule maps the user actions captured on the domain to your application. OneAgent uses the host portion of the URL to determine the domain. If an uninstrumented component between the browser and the first instrumented tier rewrites the host, you need to [configure the host name determination](#rum-appdetection-uninstrumentedcomponent). Otherwise, OneAgent might not be able to apply your application detection rule.

**Actions still map to the placeholder application**. If user actions still map to **My web application** instead of your application, refer to [How quickly do application detection rule changes take effect?](#rum-appdetection-rule-changes).

## Application detection rules approach

If you want to create more applications, change existing application mappings, or if you need to define more complex rules based not only on domains but also on URLs, you can use the **Application detection** settings page.

The URLs used for application detection have the `scheme://host:port/path?query` structure, where the query string is optional and default ports `80` for HTTP and `443` for HTTPS are omitted. The URL does not include a possible fragment identifier as in `scheme://host:port/path?query#fragment`, since application detection rules are evaluated on the server side of the application and the fragment identifier is only used by the browser and not added to web requests.

To add an application detection rule

1. Go to **Settings** > **Web and mobile monitoring** > **Application detection**. The list of application detection rules is displayed.  
   For each application defined using the [suggested approach](#automated-approach), a detection rule is automatically generated and added to the end of the list. Rules are applied sequentially, with rules at the top of the list taking priority over rules listed further down.
2. Select **Add detection rule**.
3. Use the options offered on the page to create the appropriate detection rule for your application.  
   You can apply rules to new or existing applications as well as create rules based on your application URL or domain (host).
4. Select **Save** to create an application detection rule.  
   The rule is placed at the very end of the application detection rules list.
5. Optional Select and hold **Drag row** ![Drag handle](https://dt-cdn.net/images/drag-handle-turquoise-600-1aa0e5ea00.svg "Drag handle") next to the rule name, and move the rule up or down in the list to change its priority.

You can create up to 1,000 application detection rules per environment.

### Possible issues for the application detection rules approach

**Uninstrumented component rewrites the URL**. If an uninstrumented component between the browser and the first instrumented tier rewrites the URL, then special considerations must be made (see [What can I do if an uninstrumented component rewrites parts of the URL?](#rum-appdetection-uninstrumentedcomponent) for more details). Otherwise, OneAgent might not be able to apply your application detection rules.

**Actions still map to the previous application**. If user actions still map to their previous application instead of the required one, refer to [How quickly do application detection rule changes take effect?](#rum-appdetection-rule-changes).

### FAQ for the suggested and application detection rules approaches

How does Dynatrace apply your application detection rules?

Application detection rules are evaluated on the server side of your application by OneAgent on the first instrumented tierâthe one nearest to the browser. The result is propagated to subsequent OneAgents using the `x-dynatrace-application` header. With this approach, any URL rewriting that might happen between the instrumented server-side tiers of your application does not influence the application detection result.

OneAgent adds an `app` parameter to the RUM JavaScript injected into the HTML code of your application. This parameter contains the ID of the detected application.

![App parameter in the RUM JavaScript](https://dt-cdn.net/images/injected-app-parameter-2505-7ee0111d11.png)

When sending beacon requests with the captured user actions, the RUM JavaScript includes this `app` parameter into the query string.

![App parameter added to the query string](https://dt-cdn.net/images/app-parameter-in-beacon-query-1922-30c91adb9b.png)

On the Dynatrace cluster, the `app` parameter in the beacon query string is used to assign user actions to applications.

To check the ID of an application to compare it to the `app` parameter

1. In Dynatrace, go to **Web**.
2. Select your application.
3. Check the URL of the page you are currently on. This URL contains a `uemapplicationId` parameter, for example, `uemapplicationId=APPLICATION-4CC1C5694BF9B3AB`. Its value without the `APPLICATION-` prefix is the application ID you are looking for.

   ![Checking the application ID in the Dynatrace web UI](https://dt-cdn.net/images/application-id-2559-b6b9f31629.png)

What can I do if an uninstrumented component rewrites parts of the URL?

As explained in [How does Dynatrace apply your application detection rules?](#rum-appdetection-appparam), your application detection rules are evaluated by OneAgent on the first instrumented tier of your application. However, there may be an uninstrumented component, such as a reverse proxy or a load balancer, between the browser and the first instrumented tier of your application that rewrites the URL. As a result, the URL used for application detection differs from the URL that was originally requested by the browser. In this scenario, special considerations must be made.

### Host is rewritten

You can configure components like proxies and load balancers to transport the original host information to the backend in a request header, for example, in the [`X-Forwarded-Host`ï»¿](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-Host) or [`Forwarded`ï»¿](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Forwarded) header. OneAgent can retrieve the original host from one of these headers or from any proprietary header that has the same format as `X-Forwarded-Host`.

![Passing the original host information in the X-Forwarded-Host header](https://dt-cdn.net/images/host-name-determination-1093-9025d73d9b.png)

To use the original host name in application detection

1. Configure your uninstrumented component to add a header that forwards the original host name (if it doesn't already do that by default).  
   For instance, if the original host name requested by the browser was `www.example.com`, and your uninstrumented component forwarded the request to the `backend.com` internal host, then the component has to add a request header that passes `www.example.com` as shown in the sequence diagram above.
2. In Dynatrace, go to **Settings** > **Web and mobile monitoring** > **Host name determination**.
3. If the header added by your component is missing in the list, select **Add HTTP header**.
4. The request headers in the list are processed sequentially, with the ones at the top of the list taking priority. Move your new entry above the `Host` header, which is part of every HTTP/1.1 request.

Alternatively, you can also use the internal host name in your application detection rule. However, OneAgent uses the result of host name determination not only for application detection but also for [automatic determination of the cookie domain](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/configure-the-cookie-domain#automatic-cookie-domain-determination "Learn when and how to configure the cookie domain."). Therefore, if you do not configure host name determination as described above, you need to configure the cookie domain manually as described in [Manual configuration of the cookie domain](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/configure-the-cookie-domain#manual-cookie-domain-config "Learn when and how to configure the cookie domain."). The recommended choice is the [eTLD+1ï»¿](https://web.dev/same-site-same-origin/) of the domain, which OneAgent determines automatically.

### URL path is rewritten

In contrast to the host part of the URL, there is no feature to determine the original URL path, since it is uncommon for components to set headers that communicate the original path to subsequent tiers. Therefore, you cannot use a part of the URL path, which is removed by URL rewriting on an uninstrumented component, in your application detection rule.

How quickly do application detection rule changes take effect?

When you change your application detection rules, the updated rules are usually communicated to OneAgent within a minute. OneAgent categorizes incoming requests as configured in your application detection rules and sets the `app` parameter in the injected RUM JavaScript accordingly. The RUM JavaScript then reports its beacons using the updated `app` parameter that determines how the captured user actions are categorized. For more details, see [How does Dynatrace apply application detection rules?](#rum-appdetection-appparam).

The following factors might delay the effectiveness of the updated application detection rules:

* The HTML code is served through a CDN or other cache. In this case, OneAgent can inject the RUM JavaScript only when the HTML code is evicted from the cache and requested from the instrumented origin server again.
* The application specifies a long expiration time for the HTML document using the `Expires` response header or the `max-age` directive of the `Cache-Control` response header. A cache might serve it as long as specified in these headers, including the injected `app` parameter. A change in the application detection rules cannot be reflected immediately, since the cache does not send a request to the origin server while the document has not expired.
* If an application does not specify an explicit expiration time, then this does not mean that the page may not be cached (see [RFC7234: Calculating heuristic freshnessï»¿](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7234#section-4.2.2)). The cache may use the page without revalidation as long as it deems appropriate, unless the response contains directives that prevent this, for example, `Cache-Control: no-cache`.
* Single-page applications rewrite the current page dynamically instead of loading a new page from the server. If the HTML code was loaded into the browser tab before the application detection rules changed, then the categorization of the captured XHR user actions does not reflect the updated configuration yet. This changes as soon as the page is refreshed.

## Agentless RUM approach

When you don't have access to your web serverâand therefore can't install OneAgent on the hostâbut when you have access to your application code, opt for [agentless RUM](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/set-up-agentless-real-user-monitoring "Set up agentless monitoring for your web applications.").

For some technologies, [automatic RUM JavaScript injection](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/rum-injection "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your applications") is not supported even when you can install OneAgent. For example, while OneAgent can monitor the server side of a Heroku application, it cannot inject the RUM JavaScript into the application's pages. If that's the case, you need to use agentless RUM and manually add the RUM JavaScript to your application's pages.

For a list of technologies and servers that support automatic RUM JavaScript injection, see [Technology support - Real User Monitoring - Web servers and applications](/docs/ingest-from/technology-support#rum-auto-injection "Find technical details related to Dynatrace support for specific platforms and development frameworks.").

## Best practices and recommendations

* Define your applications based on team ownership so that you can easily make use of [management zones](/docs/manage/identity-access-management/permission-management/management-zones "Learn about management zones concepts, how to define management zones, and how to make the most of them.") for access restrictions.
* It may make sense to define applications based on their technology stack so that the right settings are applied and the management of specific settings is easier. For example, activating support for specific XHR frameworks is typically required only for specific parts of a large application and for specific user action naming rules. It may help separate such large applications into smaller ones based on the technologies in use or team ownership.
* **My web application** placeholder application

  + Avoid renaming the **My web application** placeholder application, as it includes all user actions on all domains that are not included in an application detection rule. If you rename **My web application**, it might be difficult to distinguish it from your other applications.
  + It's impossible to delete this placeholder application.
  + If you can't find the **My web application** placeholder application, someone might have renamed it. To locate it, open any other application and replace the application ID in the URL with `EA7C4B59F27D43EB`. You'll be redirected to **My web application**.
  + In new environments, youâll only see this placeholder application after the traffic from an auto-injected application starts coming.
* Separating applications based on domains works best as Dynatrace cannot correlate user actions across domains with specific user sessions. This correlation is done via a cookie and therefore only works if the cookie can be set on the same domain. For example, user actions for `www.dynatrace.com` and `blog.dynatrace.com` can be captured in a single application as the cookie can be set to `dynatrace.com`. However, the traffic for `www.dynatrace.com` and `www.internal-dynatrace.com` cannot be captured in a single user session. You can still separate user actions based on the domain, but user sessions cannot include user actions from multiple domains. See [User sessions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/rum-concepts/user-session "Learn how a user session is defined, when a user session starts or ends, how user session duration is calculated, and more.") for more details.
* Group low-traffic applications. If you create an application based on a domain that has fewer than 10 actions per minute, Dynatrace won't automatically detect anomalies for this newly created application. Dynatrace depends on steady application traffic to correctly [learn multidimensional baselines and automatically report application problems](/docs/dynatrace-intelligence/anomaly-detection/static-thresholds-infrastructure "Learn about the fixed thresholds used by Dynatrace to determine when a detected slowdown or error-rate increase justifies the generation of a new problem event."). You can change your application anomaly detection settings on the **Anomaly detection** page within your application settings. Although this recommendation contradicts the one mentioned above, it may make sense to combine low-traffic applications.
* The application detection rules are processed in sequence for each request. More rules means more processing time, and as the rules are processed within OneAgents, you should try to have the rules for the applications with the most traffic at the top of the list. As soon as one rule matches, no further requests are processed.
* The more specific application detection rules should be defined first, while the more generic rules should be at the bottom of the application detection rules list.  
  Let's assume that you want to create an application called `A` onto which the following two domains will be mapped:

  `http://www.mydomain.com/cms/directory/shop/index.html`  
  `http://shop.differentdomain.de/index.html`

  and another application `B` for the following domain:

  `http://newdomain.co.uk/hello/shop.html`

  If you create a generic grouping rule based on the `shop` value, all three domains will be grouped into the same web application for monitoring. Therefore, you should first define a more specific rule, for example, "If the URL ends with `shop.html`" so that only the third URL is mapped to application `B`. Then you can safely define a generic rule based on the `shop` value, as the third URL will have already been mapped to the previous application and therefore won't be included in application `A`.
* Depending on your requirements, you can adjust the monitoring consumption and configure Real User Monitoring accordingly.
* To monitor traffic on a single application, you can opt to use [user actions and session properties](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/define-user-action-and-session-properties "Define custom string, numeric, and date properties for your monitored web applications."). To monitor separate applications and get complete insights into consumption per application, you can configure separate applications, use tagging to split the metrics, and define management zones.

# Link cross-origin XHR user actions and their distributed traces

# Link cross-origin XHR user actions and their distributed traces

* How-to guide
* 4-min read
* Updated on Oct 01, 2025

If you're experiencing issues linking user actions to their corresponding traces, also refer to [Troubleshooting RUM correlation issues for web applicationsï»¿](https://dt-url.net/io63ls2).

Dynatrace links user actions and their corresponding [distributed traces](/docs/observe/application-observability/distributed-traces "Gain observability into highly distributed, cloud-native architectures to effectively trace and analyze transactions in real time.") to provide gapless end-to-end visibility. For example, this allows you to determine the [top 3 web requests contributors](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/analyze-individual-user-actions#top-3-web-request-contributors "Understand how you can access user action detail pages and analyze user actions.") on the user action details page or to drill down from the [waterfall analysis chart](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/waterfall-analysis#purepath-drilldown "Learn how to analyze all user action monitoring data through waterfall analysis.") to distributed traces.

Linking user actions and their distributed traces works out of the box when the following conditions are met:

* The web request is a same-origin request: the web request target URL and the page where the request was issued have the same protocol, host, and port. In this case, browsers include the RUM cookies on the web request, which are required for user action to distributed trace correlation.
* The technology used on the first instrumented tier (the tier nearest to the browser) is listed in [Technology support - Real User Monitoring - Web servers and applications](/docs/ingest-from/technology-support#rum-auto-injection "Find technical details related to Dynatrace support for specific platforms and development frameworks."). For these technologies, OneAgent adds and evaluates RUM cookies.

Dynatrace cannot automatically link cross-origin XHR actions and their corresponding distributed traces. To enable such a correlation, follow one of the approaches:

* [Include cookies in cross-origin XHR calls](#include-cookies-in-cross-origin-xhr-calls-cookies-in-xhr-calls)
* [Use the `x-dtc` header](#use-the-x-dtc-header-x-dtc-header)

## Include cookies in cross-origin XHR calls

By default, browsers do not include cookies in cross-origin requests due to the [same-origin policyï»¿](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy), which restricts how your page interacts with resources from another origin. You can use [CORS requests with credentialsï»¿](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#requests_with_credentials) to add the RUM cookies and thus link cross-origin XHRs and their distributed traces.

For this approach, the following prerequisites must be met:

* The technology used on the first instrumented tier is listed in [Technology support - Real User Monitoring - Web servers and applications](/docs/ingest-from/technology-support#rum-auto-injection "Find technical details related to Dynatrace support for specific platforms and development frameworks.").
* The two domains involved have at least a common [effective top-level domain plus one (eTLD+1)ï»¿](https://web.dev/same-site-same-origin/) to allow the specification of a common [cookie domain](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/configure-the-cookie-domain "Learn when and how to configure the cookie domain.").

To include cookies in cross-origin XHR calls

1. In your JavaScript code, set the [`withCredentials` propertyï»¿](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/withCredentials) on the XMLHttpRequest object to `true`. If you use Fetch, set the [`credentials` propertyï»¿](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/credentials) to `include`.
2. Configure the server that handles the web request to respond with an `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` header and an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header that contains the specific origin (that is, not a wildcard).
3. If you [configure the cookie domain manually](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/configure-the-cookie-domain#manual-cookie-domain-config "Learn when and how to configure the cookie domain."), make sure that you choose one that covers both of the domains involved. If [automatic cookie domain determination](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/configure-the-cookie-domain#automatic-cookie-domain-determination "Learn when and how to configure the cookie domain.") is used, which is the default, then the determined cookie domain already meets this requirement.

When the cross-origin XHR action uses an HTTP method, request header, or content type that requires the browser to issue a [preflight requestï»¿](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS#Preflighted_requests), Dynatrace cannot link this preflight, since preflight requests do not contain cookies.

## Use the `x-dtc` header

To follow the cookie-based approach described above, the involved domains must allow the specification of a common cookie domain. The header-based approach does not have this limitation. This approach is supported for the technologies listed in [Technology support - Real User Monitoring - Web servers and applications](/docs/ingest-from/technology-support#rum-auto-injection "Find technical details related to Dynatrace support for specific platforms and development frameworks.") and by the [OneAgent extension for AWS Lambda](/docs/ingest-from/amazon-web-services/integrate-into-aws/aws-lambda-integration/aws-lambda-classic/aws-lambda-extension#lambda-cfg-rum "Monitor Lambda functions written in Python, Node.js, and Java.").

The `x-dtc` header is a custom HTTP header added by the RUM JavaScript and contains information that is otherwise propagated using the RUM cookies. Its addition needs to be explicitly enabled because the endpoints that handle the cross-origin requests need to be configured to accept the header.

Do not enable the addition of the `x-dtc` header unless you acknowledge the following:

* The addition of the `x-dtc` header to link cross-origin XHR user actions and their distributed traces is optional.
* You understand the steps required to prepare your endpoints.
* If you do not configure your endpoints correctly before enabling the header addition, your web application may break.
* You fully accept that Dynatrace is neither responsible nor liable for any application malfunction caused by any misconfiguration.
* You should always enable the addition of the `x-dtc` header in a test environment first.

To link cross-origin XHR user actions and their distributed traces using the `x-dtc` header, configure endpoints to accept `x-dtc`, and then add a regex that matches XHR calls.

1. Configure the endpoints that handle the cross-origin requests to accept the `x-dtc` header. The endpoints must handle the [preflight requestsï»¿](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS#Preflighted_requests) that the browser issues due to the addition of the header. In particular, the responses to the preflight requests need to contain an `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: x-dtc` header. Otherwise, the XHR will fail with a CORS error.
2. In Dynatrace, go to **Web**.
3. Select the application that you want to configure.
4. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
5. From the application settings, select **Capturing** > **Advanced setup**.
6. Under **Enable Real User Monitoring for cross-origin XHR calls**, specify a regular expression that matches the XHR calls.

If the `x-dtc` header is not added to the request after following the directions above, check your regular expression and ensure that [RUM is configured to capture XHR actions](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/configure-dynatrace-real-user-monitoring-to-capture-xhr-actions "Understand why you need to activate specific JavaScript frameworks for XHR-action support and learn how to configure Real User Monitoring for XHR actions.").

Only the actual request can be linked not the preflight request.

# Configure automatic injection

# Configure automatic injection

* How-to guide
* Updated on Jul 01, 2025

Once OneAgent is deployed in full-stack monitoring mode on a host, it by default automatically injects the RUM JavaScript into the HTML of your web applications for the technologies listed in [Technology support - Real User Monitoring - Web servers and applications](/docs/ingest-from/technology-support#rum-auto-injection "Find technical details related to Dynatrace support for specific platforms and development frameworks."). To initiate injection, simply restart your web server processes after installing OneAgent.

By default, injection follows a set of [built-in rules for automatic injection](#where-is-rum-js-injected), but there are scenarios where you may need to define a [custom injection rule](#custom-injection-rule) to achieve injection. Custom injection rules also support the [exclusion of specific pages from injection](#disable-injection), which allows you to set up [manual insertion for the pages of an auto-injected application](#manual-insertion-using-oneagent).

The RUM JavaScript is responsible for collecting RUM data from your customers' web browsers. It sends this data as XHR POST requests to a beacon endpoint, which performs initial validation before forwarding the data to Dynatrace. The default beacon endpoint in automatic injection scenarios is provided by the OneAgent instrumenting your web or application server, but alternative setups are possible, see [Configure beacon endpoint for web applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/beacon-endpoint "Change the default beacon endpoint URL and send RUM beacons to Dynatrace infrastructure or another instrumented web server.").

The RUM JavaScript snippet injected into your application's HTML can vary in format, each designed to meet specific requirements as outlined in [Select a snippet format](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case").
To configure the format used for automatic injection, refer to [Configure the snippet format](#configure-snippet-format).

OneAgent injects the RUM JavaScript into each page based on the current configuration whenever the instrumented web or application server delivers the page. However, the pageâs caching policy determines how frequently OneAgent has the opportunity to perform this injection. To address this, OneAgent includes a feature that optimizes cache control headers. For details on how this feature works and its limitations, see [Cache control header optimizations](#cache-header-optimization).

If you don't have access to the web server hosting your application and therefore can't install OneAgent, you can monitor your application using [agentless RUM](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/set-up-agentless-real-user-monitoring "Set up agentless monitoring for your web applications.").

## Built-in rules for automatic injection

OneAgent detects responses containing HTML content and injects the RUM JavaScript into the head section of each page. It does not modify other resources such as images, CSS files, JSON or XML documents, or plain text.

OneAgent tries to inject the RUM JavaScript as the first script on the page, which helps to ensure reliable monitoring results. Injection only works with valid HTML that follows basic best practicesâfor example, ensuring all elements are properly opened and closed. OneAgent follows the built-in rules specified below to determine the most suitable location within an HTML document for injecting the RUM JavaScript.

### Automatic injection rules specification

Name

Condition

Action

Overrules

<!DOCTYPE>

The `<!DOCTYPE>` tag is not `<!DOCTYPE html>`.

The document's contents don't appear to exhibit the basic structure expected from HTML tags and attributes

Document scan stops.

If a potential injection point is found earlier, inject there, and do not scan further. If there are multiple potential injection points, the earliest one is used.

If no rule provides an earlier injection point, don't perform an injection

If you're unsure whether the RUM JavaScript was injected successfully or you're experiencing issues with your RUM setup, refer to [Web applications: Issues with RUM JavaScriptï»¿](https://dt-url.net/up03l19).

## Explicitly specify where the RUM JavaScript should be injected

In some cases, OneAgent may be unable to perform injection using the [built-in rules](#where-is-rum-js-injected). This is typically due to malformed HTML, though other rare conditions may also prevent the ruleset from identifying a suitable injection point. In such scenarios, you can achieve automatic injection by defining a custom injection rule that explicitly specifies where the RUM JavaScript should be injected within the HTML document.

To create a custom injection rule that specifies the injection point in the HTML document

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **Injection** > **Custom injection rules**.
5. Under **Define custom injection rules**, select **Add custom rule**.
6. Define the **Operator** and, if required, the corresponding **URL pattern** to control to which pages your custom injection rule applies.
7. Under **Rule**, select either **Before specific HTML** or **After specific HTML**, and enter the corresponding HTML pattern.
8. Select **Save changes** to create the custom injection rule.

## Disable injection for particular pages

To disable injection for one or more pages within your application

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **Injection** > **Custom injection rules**.
5. Under **Define custom injection rules**, select **Add custom rule**.
6. Define the **Operator** and, if required, the corresponding **URL pattern** to control to which pages your custom injection rule applies.
7. Under **Rule**, select **Do not inject**.
8. Select **Save changes** to create the custom injection rule.

This rule only disables injection and [cache control header optimizations](#cache-header-optimization); it does not fully disable RUM functionality. For instance, cookies may still be set. If you're looking for a way to selectively enable RUM, please refer to the instructions in [Roll out RUM selectively for your applications](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/selective-rum-rollout "Roll out RUM selectively after installing OneAgent in full-stack monitoring mode on your hosts").

## Configure the snippet format

To configure the snippet format for automatic injection

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **Injection** > **Automatic injection**.
5. Under **Snippet format**, select the desired format.

To learn more about the different snippet formats, refer to [Select a snippet format](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case").

## Cache control header optimizations

ð¢ Enabled by default

Your application's caching policy directly influences how often OneAgent can inject the RUM JavaScript into a page using the current configuration. To ensure timely application of configuration changes, the cache control header optimizations feature modifies HTTP headers so that conditional requests result in a cache miss whenever the RUM configuration has changed, giving OneAgent a chance to inject. Details of these optimizations and the specific header modifications are provided below.

Cache control header optimizations specification

When the cache control header optimization is turned on and the RUM configuration has been changed, the requests that would otherwise result in `304 Not Modified` respond with `200 OK`, giving OneAgent a chance to inject the RUM JavaScript into your application HTML code. If the RUM configuration hasn't been changed, the requests result in a `304 Not Modified` response.

### Modified headers

OneAgent modifies the following response and request headers:

#### Response headers

* `ETag`
* `Last-Modified`

#### Request headers

* `If-None-Match`
* `If-Modified-Since`
* `If-Unmodified-Since`[1](#fn-1-1-def)
* `If-Match`[1](#fn-1-1-def)

1

Not modified for range requests, which are generally excluded from RUM monitoring.

Here's how OneAgent modifies the cache control headers.

#### When the RUM configuration is changed

* The incoming `If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since` request headers are removed.
* Modifications made to the `If-Unmodified-Since` and `If-Match` headers are removed.
* When both `ETag` and `Last-Modified` headers are used:

  + A suffix is appended to the `ETag` header.
  + One second is subtracted from the `Last-Modified` header.
* When only the `ETag` header is used:

  + A suffix is appended to the `ETag` header.
* When only the `Last-Modified` header is used:

  + The `ETag` header is created.
  + One second is subtracted from the `Last-Modified` header.

#### When the RUM configuration isn't changed

* Before the request is handled by the web or app server, the modifications made to the headers are removed so that the web or app server doesn't see the changes.

When the application consists of multiple instrumented tiers, the changes to the `ETag` and `Last-Modified` headers are applied on each tier.

OneAgent does not alter the `Expires` and `Cache-Control` headers, which explicitly define resource expiration times. To ensure timely updates, we recommend setting shorter expiration durations in these headers.

### Disabling cache control header optimizations

In rare cases, cache control header optimizations may interfere with your application's functionality. If this occurs, you can disable the feature.
When disabled, the rollout of new RUM configurations will depend entirely on your application's existing caching behavior.

To disable the cache control header optimizations

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **Injection** > **Automatic injection**.
5. Turn off **Optimize the value of cache control headers for use with Dynatrace Real User Monitoring**.
6. Select **Save changes**.

### Disabling cache control header optimizations for non-HTML resources

In some cases, OneAgent may modify the cache control headers of non-HTML resources. This occurs because header modifications are applied before the exact content type can be determined. While OneAgent excludes certain resources from cache control header optimizations based on their URI suffix, it's not possible to account for all non-HTML content types.

If you want to prevent cache control header modifications for specific non-HTML resources, you can create a [custom injection rule that disables injection for those resources](#disable-injection).

## Use manual insertion for pages of an auto-injected application

If OneAgent is deployed on your process groups and automatic injection is supported for your technology, then OneAgent injects the RUM JavaScript automatically by default. But if you prefer, you can insert it manually instead into all or specific pages.

First, you need to suppress automatic injection as described in [Disable injection for particular pages](#disable-injection). Then, to insert the RUM JavaScript manually

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **Injection** > **Manual insertion**.
5. Select the required [snippet format](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case"), and copy the provided snippet.
6. Insert the snippet in your HTML before any other scripts.

Alternatively, you can also retrieve the snippet via the [API](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/real-user-monitoring-javascript-code "Learn how you can use the Dynatrace API to set up and maintain your manually injected applications using the Real User Monitoring JavaScript API."), which allows you to integrate its insertion into your build process. This ensures that your application consistently operates with the latest configuration.

# Set up agentless Real User Monitoring

# Set up agentless Real User Monitoring

* How-to guide
* 8-min read
* Updated on Oct 29, 2025

Agentless Real User Monitoring is designed to be used when you don't have access to your web server (and therefore can't install OneAgent), but when you have access to your application code.

The full benefits of Real User Monitoring can be obtained only after you've installed Dynatrace OneAgent. See [OneAgent installation is recommended](#oneagent-is-better) for more details.

## Prerequisites

Here's what you'll need to set up agentless Real User Monitoring:

* Access to your application's HTML source so that you can insert the RUM JavaScript
* RUM JavaScriptâa custom JavaScript tag, code, or snippet generated by Dynatrace

## Set up agentless monitoring

Perform the following actions to set up agentless monitoring.

[![Step 1](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-1-086e22066c.svg "Step 1")

**Create an application and insert RUM JavaScript**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/set-up-agentless-real-user-monitoring#saas-create-app-add-code "Set up agentless monitoring for your web applications.")[![Step 2 optional](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dotted-step-2-8ae6982454.svg "Step 2 optional")

**Choose another RUM JavaScript snippet format**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/set-up-agentless-real-user-monitoring#saas-choose-insertion-format "Set up agentless monitoring for your web applications.")[![Step 3](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-3-350cf6c19a.svg "Step 3")

**Keep RUM JavaScript up-to-date**](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/set-up-agentless-real-user-monitoring#saas-keep-code-updated "Set up agentless monitoring for your web applications.")

### Step 1 Create an application and insert RUM JavaScript

1. In Dynatrace Hub, select **Web application monitoring via manual insertion**.
2. Select **Set up**.

3. Enter your application name and select **Add web application**. A custom JavaScript code snippet is generated for your application.
4. Select **Copy code snippet** to copy the generated JavaScript code to the clipboard. The code generated after you've created the application is in the [JavaScript tag](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats#js-tag "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case") format.

   Dynatrace offers several snippet formats of the RUM JavaScript. If youâre considering using a different snippet format, refer to the next step for guidance.
5. Paste the JavaScript code snippet into the `<head>` element of all of HTML pages that you want to monitor in your application. Ensure that the RUM JavaScript is the first executable script on each page.

   For many websites, it's possible to add custom JavaScript to all pages at once by inserting the code to be reused into a centralized `header.html` file. If possible, use this file to insert the RUM JavaScript to avoid unnecessary work.

The following example shows the code for a simple page before and after RUM JavaScript insertion.

Before injection

After injection

```
<html>



<head>



<title>MyApp</title>



<script type="text/javascript" src="myapp.js"></script>



</head>



<body>



<form>



Username: <input type="text name="username"/><br/>



Password: <input type="password" name="password"/><br/>



<input type="submit" value="Login">



</form>
```

```
<html>



<head>



<title>MyApp</title>



<script type="text/javascript" src="https://js-cdn.dynatrace.com/jstag/145e12d594f/cg36988wxq/477g8ec68708x5c1_complete.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>



<script type="text/javascript" src="myapp.js"></script>



</head>



<body>



<form>



Username: <input type="text name="username"/><br/>



Password: <input type="password" name="password"/><br/>



<input type="submit" value="Login">



</form>
```

If you already have an application that's set up for agentless monitoring, select **Applications currently set up for agentless monitoring** in step 3 of the instructions above instead of entering your application name. You can then view the list of applications already set up for agentless monitoring and their corresponding JavaScript tags, codes, or snippets. This is useful when you've already added the RUM JavaScript to some of your pages and want to extend monitoring visibility to other pages.

### Step 2 optional Choose another RUM JavaScript snippet format Optional

While the JavaScript tag format is the ideal choice for the majority of use cases, Dynatrace offers several snippet formats of the RUM JavaScript to meet a variety of requirements. Select the format that fits your application best and meets your requirements. For detailed descriptions of all formats, see [Select a snippet format](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case").

To get a different snippet format of the RUM JavaScript

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **Injection** > **Manual insertion**.
5. Choose the required snippet format, then select **Copy** to copy it to the clipboard.

### Step 3 Keep RUM JavaScript up-to-date

If you want the RUM JavaScript to be updated automatically, choose the [JavaScript tag snippet format](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats#js-tag "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case"). For other snippet formats, you need to manually update the RUM JavaScript.

Dynatrace offers a REST API that allows you to retrieve the latest RUM JavaScript for your application. You can automatically inject the latest RUM JavaScript during the build time of your application. To learn how to use the API, see [RUM manual insertion tags API](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/rum-manual-insertion-tags "Learn how you can download the RUM manual insertion tags via API").

## Things to consider

### OneAgent installation is recommended

Installation of Dynatrace OneAgent is preferable to agentless monitoring for the following reasons:

* With agentless monitoring, you need to manually insert the RUM JavaScript into each of your application's pages, which might be challenging. Dynatrace OneAgent handles the insertion of the RUM JavaScript for you.
* Unless you use the **JavaScript tag** [snippet format](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats#js-tag "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case") for agentless monitoring, the RUM JavaScript embedded into your application's pages is not automatically updated when you change your application monitoring settings. You'll have to update the code manually.

For a list of technologies and servers that support automatic RUM JavaScript injection, see [Technology support - Real User Monitoring - Web servers and applications](/docs/ingest-from/technology-support#rum-auto-injection "Find technical details related to Dynatrace support for specific platforms and development frameworks.").

For some technologies, [automatic RUM JavaScript injection](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/rum-injection#automatic-injection "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your applications") is not supported even when you can install OneAgent. For example, while OneAgent can monitor the server side of a Heroku application, it can't inject the RUM JavaScript into the application's pages. If that's the case, manually add the RUM JavaScript to your application's pages.

### Performance impact

To minimize the impact of the RUM JavaScript on the page load time, you might want to load scripts as late as possible. Use blocking script tags to ensure that the RUM JavaScript is executed exactly where you've placed it. If you need a script to run as early as possible, the execution can't be postponed.

One way to avoid these additional blocking requests during page load is to inline the script code. The script code needs to be inlined into each document, thereby propagating the data of a single cached file into every page of your application. By combining both these approaches, you can get an inline JavaScript snippet that performs the required initialization and defers the loading of the bulky code to a second script.

### Maintenance effort

Agentless monitoring requires you to insert the RUM JavaScript by yourself, so make sure that it requires as little manual effort as possible. If you don't want to have to change your code every time your application monitoring settings change or when a new version of the RUM JavaScript is released, opt for the **JavaScript tag** [snippet format](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats#js-tag "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case").

### Standards and security policies

Certain development standards that are created to make applications more secure and faster also introduce new limitations.

For example, the [Content Security Policy (CSP) standardï»¿](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP), which was introduced to minimize the chance of becoming a victim of cross-site scripting, disallows inline JavaScript code. This means that you might need to use the **JavaScript tag** [snippet format of the RUM JavaScript](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats#js-tag "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case").

### User action to distributed trace correlation

For agentless monitoring, the ability to link user actions and [distributed traces](/docs/observe/application-observability/distributed-traces "Gain observability into highly distributed, cloud-native architectures to effectively trace and analyze transactions in real time.") depends on the technologies that your application uses.

* If your application is instrumented with OneAgent, but [Real User Monitoring is not supported for its technology](/docs/ingest-from/technology-support#rum-auto-injection "Find technical details related to Dynatrace support for specific platforms and development frameworks."), then the distributed traces captured by this OneAgent can't be linked to user actions.
* If your application issues XHR calls to [AWS Lambda](/docs/ingest-from/amazon-web-services/integrate-into-aws/aws-lambda-integration/aws-lambda-classic/aws-lambda-extension#lambda-cfg-rum "Monitor Lambda functions written in Python, Node.js, and Java.") or to another instrumented web or application server that uses the [supported technologies](/docs/ingest-from/technology-support#rum-auto-injection "Find technical details related to Dynatrace support for specific platforms and development frameworks."), then it's possible to link user actions and distributed traces. However, these web requests are usually cross-origin requests, so additional configuration is required to achieve the user action to distributed trace correlation. See [Link cross-origin XHR user actions and their distributed traces](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/link-cross-origin-xhrs "Enable the correlation between cross-origin XHR actions and distributed traces.") for details.

### Use of tag managers

We recommend ensuring that the RUM JavaScript is the first executable script on each page, which can be challenging when using a tag manager. If you cannot guarantee this, you may lose informationâsuch as certain timings or user actionsâthat are available only when both the RUM monitoring code and the configuration are fully loaded and initialized.

This risk is exacerbated if you use the [code snippet](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats#code-snippet "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case") in deferred mode, or if you configure the **Script execution** option of the [JavaScript tag](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats#js-tag "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case"), [OneAgent JavaScript tag](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats#oneagent-js-tag "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case"), or [OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/snippet-formats#oneagent-js-tag-sri "Select a format for the RUM JavaScript snippet that best fits your specific use case") to **async** or **defer**.

## Verify agentless monitoring setup

To investigate problems that you might encounter with agentless Real User Monitoring, confirm the following:

* The pages to be monitored contain the RUM JavaScript.
* The RUM JavaScript is correctly downloaded by the browser (assuming you're not using inline injection).

  Use the browser developer tools to check if the response for the RUM JavaScript is `200` and if the response body contains the RUM JavaScript.

* The response of the beacon endpoint starts with `OK(BF)`.
* The application in the Dynatrace web UI shows data.

# Select a snippet format

# Select a snippet format

* How-to guide
* Published Jul 01, 2025

The RUM JavaScriptâwhether [automatically injected](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/rum-injection "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your applications") or [manually inserted](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/set-up-agentless-real-user-monitoring "Set up agentless monitoring for your web applications.") into your web applicationâconsists of two key components:

* **Monitoring code**: The JavaScript code that provides RUM capabilities such as capturing user actions.
* **Configuration**: The application configuration that is initially used by the monitoring code. It is updated later via the RUM beacon response in case of configuration changes.

Dynatrace RUM provides several snippet formats that integrate these components into your pages in different ways, each tailored to meet specific requirements.

This page [offers guidance](#snippet-format-recommendations) to help you choose the snippet format that best meets your requirements, followed by a [detailed description of each format](#snippet-format-details).

## Recommendations for selecting the snippet format

For most use cases, we recommend the following:

* Use the [JavaScript Tag](#js-tag) for manual insertion.
* Use the [OneAgent JavaScript Tag](#oneagent-js-tag) for automatic injection.

If you want to leverage the subresource integrity (SRI) browser feature to ensure that the monitoring code hasn't been altered, use [OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI](#oneagent-js-tag-sri) for manual insertion and automatic injection.

To avoid parse-blocking execution of the monitoring code, configure the **script execution** option of your selected snippet format to **async** or **defer**. Instructions for configuring this option are provided in the documentation for each individual snippet format below. Keep in mind that while the monitoring code is not yet fully loaded and initialized, certain timings and user actions will be lost.

## Available snippet formats

JavaScript tag

OneAgent JavaScript tag

OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI

Inline code

Code snippet

**JavaScript tag** links to an external file that includes both the monitoring code and the configuration. JavaScript tag is only available for manual insertion.

[Get JavaScript tag via API](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/rum-manual-insertion-tags/get-javascript-tag)

##### Updates

The short cache duration used for the external file ensures regular automatic updates, making JavaScript tag an ideal choice if you don't want to take care of updating the inserted snippet after configuration changes.

##### Monitoring code source

The external file is loaded from the Dynatrace CDN.

##### Cache duration

The external file containing monitoring code and configuration is updated according to its cache duration, which is one hour by default and can be configured. The available values are lowâa few hours or daysâto ensure the configuration is updated regularly. The cache duration specifies how long browsers can cache the file. The Dynatrace CDN caches it for one hour.

To configure the cache duration

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **Injection** > **Manual insertion**.
5. In the **JavaScript tag** section, use the dropdown under **Cache monitoring code and configuration for** to select the required cache duration.

##### Script execution

By default, the monitoring code is loaded and executed synchronously by the browser. To avoid parse-blocking behavior, you can configure the addition of the `async` or `defer` attributes.

* With the `async` attribute, the monitoring code is loaded in parallel with page parsing and executed immediately once itâs available.
* With the `defer` attribute, the monitoring code is also loaded in parallel, but execution is deferred until after the page has finished parsing.

With both attributes, certain timings and user actions will be lost while the monitoring code is not yet fully loaded and initialized.

To configure script execution

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **Injection** > **Manual insertion**.
5. In the **JavaScript tag** section, set **Script execution attribute** to **async**, **defer**, or **No attribute**.
6. Copy the snippet and insert it into your page.

When fetching the JavaScript tag via the API, you can control script execution by passing a parameter. For details, see [GET JavaScript tag](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/rum-manual-insertion-tags/get-javascript-tag "Retrieve the most recent JavaScript tag for manual insertion.").

##### Addition of the `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute

ð¢ Enabled by default

The external script referenced by JavaScript tag is served from the Dynatrace CDN, resulting in a cross-origin request. To enable the collection of detailed JavaScript error messages and W3C resource timings, you need to include the `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute in the script tag.

To enable the addition of the `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **Injection** > **Manual insertion**.
5. In the **JavaScript tag** section, enable **Add the crossorigin=anonymous attribute**.
6. Copy the snippet and insert it into your page.

When fetching the JavaScript tag via the API, you can control the addition of the `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute by passing a parameter. For details, see [GET JavaScript tag](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/rum-manual-insertion-tags/get-javascript-tag "Retrieve the most recent JavaScript tag for manual insertion.").

**OneAgent JavaScript tag** includes the configuration and links to an external file containing the monitoring code. It's available for both manual insertion and automatic injection.

[Get OneAgent JavaScript tag via API](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/rum-manual-insertion-tags/get-oneagent-javascript-tag)

##### Updates

When inserting the OneAgent JavaScript tag manually, it must also be manually updated whenever configuration changes occur. To ensure it remains current, we recommend using it together with fully automated updates via the API. Using OneAgent JavaScript tag from the web UI is discouraged unless timely configuration updates are not critical.

In case of automatic injection, OneAgent always injects the OneAgent JavaScript tag using the current configuration. Note, however, that the caching policy of your application may influence how often OneAgent gets a chance to inject. For more information, see [Cache control header optimizations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/rum-injection#cache-header-optimization "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your applications").

##### Monitoring code source

In case of agentless monitoring, the monitoring code is delivered by the Dynatrace CDN. In case of automatic injection or [manual insertion for pages of an auto-injected application](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/rum-injection#manual-insertion-using-oneagent "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your applications"), the file is, by default, delivered by the OneAgent that instruments your application. Alternatively, it is also possible to load it from the Dynatrace CDN, see [Request the monitoring code from the Dynatrace CDN](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/configure-monitoring-code-source#request-rum-monitoring-code-from-cdn "Configure the Real User Monitoring code source for your specific requirements.").

##### Cache duration

Both browsers and the Dynatrace CDN can cache the monitoring code for up to a year. This extended cache duration is made possible by embedding both the RUM JavaScript version and a hash of the active modules in the file URL.

##### Script execution

By default, the monitoring code is loaded and executed synchronously by the browser. To avoid parse-blocking behavior, you can configure the addition of the `async` or `defer` attributes.

* With the `async` attribute, the monitoring code is loaded in parallel with page parsing and executed immediately once itâs available.
* With the `defer` attribute, the monitoring code is also loaded in parallel, but execution is deferred until after the page has finished parsing.

With both attributes, certain timings and user actions will be lost while the monitoring code is not yet fully loaded and initialized.

To configure script execution for automatic injection

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **Injection** > **Automatic injection**.
5. If **Snippet format** is set to **OneAgent JavaScript tag**, the **Script execution attribute** option becomes available. Choose either **async**, **defer**, or **No attribute** from the dropdown.
6. Select **Save changes**.

To configure script execution for manual insertion

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **Injection** > **Manual insertion**.
5. In the **OneAgent JavaScript tag** section, set **Script execution attribute** to **async**, **defer**, or **No attribute**.
6. Copy the snippet and insert it into your page.

When fetching the OneAgent JavaScript tag via the API, you can control script execution by passing a parameter. For details, see [GET OneAgent JavaScript tag](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/rum-manual-insertion-tags/get-oneagent-javascript-tag "Retrieve the most recent OneAgent JavaScript tag for manual insertion.").

**OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI** lets you take advantage of the subresource integrity (SRI) browser feature to ensure that the monitoring code hasn't been altered, see [Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) for Real User Monitoring code](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/subresource-integrity "Use the Subresource Integrity (SRI) browser feature to ensure the integrity of Real User Monitoring code."). It includes configuration, a reference to an external file containing the monitoring code, and an integrity hash for this monitoring code. It is supported for both automatic injection and manual insertion.

[Get OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI via API](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/rum-manual-insertion-tags/get-oneagent-javascript-tag-with-sri)

##### Updates

When inserting the OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI manually, it must also be manually updated whenever configuration changes occur. To ensure it remains current, we recommend using it together with fully automated updates via the API. Using OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI from the web UI is discouraged unless timely configuration updates are not critical.

In case of automatic injection, OneAgent always injects the OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI using the current configuration. Note, however, that the caching policy of your application may influence how often OneAgent gets a chance to inject. For more information, see [Cache control header optimizations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/rum-injection#cache-header-optimization "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your applications").

##### Monitoring code source

The monitoring code is always delivered by the Dynatrace CDN.

##### Cache duration

Both browsers and the Dynatrace CDN can cache the monitoring code for up to a year. This extended cache duration is made possible by embedding both the RUM JavaScript version and a hash of the active modules in the file URL.

##### Script execution

By default, the monitoring code is loaded and executed synchronously by the browser. To avoid parse-blocking behavior, you can configure the addition of the `async` or `defer` attributes.

* With the `async` attribute, the monitoring code is loaded in parallel with page parsing and executed immediately once itâs available.
* With the `defer` attribute, the monitoring code is also loaded in parallel, but execution is deferred until after the page has finished parsing.

With both attributes, certain timings and user actions will be lost while the monitoring code is not yet fully loaded and initialized.

To configure script execution for automatic injection

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **Injection** > **Automatic injection**.
5. If **Snippet format** is set to **OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI**, the **Script execution attribute** option becomes available. Choose either **async**, **defer**, or **No attribute** from the dropdown.
6. Select **Save changes**.

2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **Injection** > **Manual insertion**.
5. In the **OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI** section, set **Script execution attribute** to **async**, **defer** or **No attribute**.
6. Copy the snippet and insert it into your page.

When fetching the OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI via the API, you can control script execution by passing a parameter. For details, see [GET OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/rum-manual-insertion-tags/get-oneagent-javascript-tag-with-sri "Retrieve the most recent OneAgent JavaScript tag with SRI for manual insertion.").

**Inline code** contains both the configuration and the RUM monitoring code, keeping the number of web requests at a minimum. Note that the Session Replay monitoring code is not inlined, so there will still be an additional request if you use Session Replay. If your website consists of many individual pages, using inline code may not be beneficial, as it increases the size of each document. However, it can be a suitable choice for single-page applications (SPAs).

[Get inline code via API](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/rum-manual-insertion-tags/get-inline-code)

##### Updates

When inserting the inline code manually, it must also be manually updated whenever configuration changes occur. To ensure it remains current, we recommend using it together with fully automated updates via the API. Using inline code from the web UI is discouraged unless timely configuration updates are not critical.

In case of automatic injection, OneAgent always injects the inline code using the current configuration. Note, however, that the caching policy of your application may influence how often OneAgent gets a chance to inject. For more information, see [Cache control header optimizations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/rum-injection#cache-header-optimization "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your applications").

##### Monitoring code source

In case of agentless monitoring, the Session Replay monitoring code is delivered by the Dynatrace CDN. In case of automatic injection or [manual insertion for pages of an auto-injected application](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/rum-injection#manual-insertion-using-oneagent "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your applications"), the Session Replay monitoring code is, by default, delivered by the OneAgent that instruments your application. Alternatively, it is also possible to load it from the Dynatrace CDN, see [Request the monitoring code from the Dynatrace CDN](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/configure-monitoring-code-source#request-rum-monitoring-code-from-cdn "Configure the Real User Monitoring code source for your specific requirements.").

##### Cache duration

Because the RUM monitoring code is inlined, its cache duration matches that of your page, which is determined by the cache settings on your web server. The Session Replay monitoring code can be cached for up to a year by both browsers and the Dynatrace CDN. This extended cache duration is made possible by embedding the RUM JavaScript version in the file URL.

##### Script execution

The monitoring code is loaded and evaluated synchronously by the browser.

**Code snippet** contains the configuration and the basic functionality of the monitoring code. It is available for both manual insertion and automatic injection.

* In case of manual insertion, it injects another script element into the page that references an external file containing the full functionality of the monitoring code.
* In case of automatic injection, this second script element is injected by OneAgent when it injects the code snippet.

The external file containing the full functionality of the monitoring code can be configured to load either synchronously or asynchronously using the `defer` attribute, see [Script execution](#code-snippet-script-execution).

[Get code snippet via API](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/real-user-monitoring-javascript-code/get-snippet-sync)

[Get code snippet in deferred mode via API](/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/rum/real-user-monitoring-javascript-code/get-snippet-async)

##### Updates

In case of manual insertion, monitoring code and configuration updates are available after the page has reloaded for the first time. To have the current configuration available from the start, the code snippet needs to be updated regularly. This is also necessary to guarantee the compatibility between the code snippet and the external file, which we test for one year.

In case of automatic injection, OneAgent always injects code snippet using the current configuration. Note, however, that the caching policy of your application may influence how often OneAgent gets a chance to inject. For more information, see [Cache control header optimizations](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/rum-injection#cache-header-optimization "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your applications").

##### Monitoring code source

In case of agentless monitoring, the external file containing the full functionality of the monitoring code is delivered by the Dynatrace CDN. In case of automatic injection or [manual insertion for pages of an auto-injected application](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/rum-injection#manual-insertion-using-oneagent "Configure automatic injection of the RUM JavaScript into the pages of your applications"), it is, by default, delivered by the OneAgent that instruments your application. Alternatively, it is also possible to load it from the Dynatrace CDN, see [Request the monitoring code from the Dynatrace CDN](/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/additional-configuration/configure-monitoring-code-source#request-rum-monitoring-code-from-cdn "Configure the Real User Monitoring code source for your specific requirements.").

##### Cache duration

The caching of the code snippet matches the caching of the page, which is determined by your web server configuration. The external file can be cached for up to a year by both browsers and the Dynatrace CDN. This extended cache duration is made possible by embedding both the RUM JavaScript version and a hash of the active modules in the file URL.

##### Script execution

The external file that provides the full functionality of the monitoring code can be configured to load either synchronously or asynchronously using the `defer` attribute. When loaded asynchronously, the script is downloaded in parallel with the HTML parsing and executed only after the entire document has been fully parsed. While the monitoring code is not yet fully loaded, certain timings and user actions will be lost.

To configure script execution for manual insertion

1. Go to **Web**.
2. Select the application that you want to configure.
3. In the upper-right corner of the application overview page, select **More** (**â¦**) > **Edit**.
4. From the application settings, select **Injection** > **Manual insertion**.
5. In the **Code snippet** section, use the dropdown under **Load the monitoring code** to select either **synchronously** or **deferred**.
6. Copy the snippet and insert it into your page.
