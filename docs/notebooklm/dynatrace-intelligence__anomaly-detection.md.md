# Anomaly detection

# Anomaly detection

* Latest Dynatrace
* Overview
* 2-min read
* Updated on Jan 28, 2026

Dynatrace continuously monitors the performance of every aspect of your applications, services, and infrastructure to automatically learn all baseline metrics and the overall health of each component in your environment, including the response times of your applications and services. Variables such as geolocation, browser type, operating system, connection bandwidth, and user actions are factored in automatically. This intelligent [automated baselining](/docs/dynatrace-intelligence/anomaly-detection/automated-multidimensional-baselining "Learn how Dynatrace AI automatically calculates baselines based on a multi-dimensional baselining scheme.") allows Dynatrace to detect anomalies at a highly granular level and to notify you of detected problems in real time. You can customize the thresholds generated through automated baselining either by [adapting the sensitivity of problem detection](/docs/dynatrace-intelligence/anomaly-detection/adjust-sensitivity-anomaly-detection "Learn how to adapt the sensitivity of problem detection in Dynatrace.") or, if necessary, by defining your own static thresholds.

## Use cases

* Create a custom alert to get notified about problems in your environment.
* Configure manually or use an auto-adaptive threshold to detect abnormal behavior.
* Set up alerts for custom events.
