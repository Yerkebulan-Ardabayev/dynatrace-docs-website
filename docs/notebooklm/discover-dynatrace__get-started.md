# Accessibility

* Latest Dynatrace
* 1-min read
* Updated on Sep 17, 2025

At Dynatrace, we aspire to provide quality products and services that promote diversity, equality, and inclusion. To achieve this goal, it is essential to follow high accessibility standards that promote the usability of our platform for individuals with disabilities.

* Dynatrace development best practices and accessibility criteria align with **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines** (WCAG), the internationally recognized standard developed by the **World Wide Web Consortium** (W3C).
* The **Voluntary Product Accessibility Template** (VPAT) is a standardized model to document how a product conforms to a set of accessibility standards.
* The VPAT is used to create an **Accessibility Conformance Report** (ACR), which provides details of how a productâs features meet this set of criteria.

Dynatrace works in conjunction with third-party vendors and tools to evaluate our accessibility posture against the WCAG standard, currently [WCAG 2.1 level AAï»¿](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

Our product accessibility journey at Dynatrace is continuous, and we are committed to iterative improvements toward WCAG 2.1 level AA compliance. The ACR linked below represents accessibility status at the time of publishing, so check back for annual updates to this report.

Disclaimer

Any ACR posted below, or anywhere else on the Dynatrace website, or otherwise publicly available, shall not be construed to be included in any contract, either explicitly or implicitly, in whole or in part, absent Dynatrace express acknowledgment through language in the contract itself that such report or its substantive equivalent is included.

# Launchpads

# Launchpads

* Latest Dynatrace
* 4-min read
* Published Sep 18, 2024

The full landscape of Dynatrace use cases can seem overwhelming, with a somewhat complex learning curve towards understanding which elements people need in their daily observability journeys through Dynatrace.

To make things easier, use the **Launcher** app to create customizable "launchpads" (customizable start pages) designed to improve user experience and efficiency. When people start Dynatrace with a launchpad, they focus on what they want to see first and have quick navigation to the Dynatrace components most important to them.

* Coordinate a project with a bigger group of people
* Manage the rollout of Dynatrace across an entire organization

## Get started with launchpads

1. In the **Launcher** app, select  **Launchpad** to add a new launchpad.
2. Select **Customize**.
3. Select a component type and start customizing it. Components you can add to your launchpad include:

   * LinksâA collection of links to Dynatrace apps and documents, as well as general links to internal or external resources
   * MarkdownâA tile of Markdown-formatted text, including links to web pages and images
   * CardsâFor each card, add a brief explanation, an optional image, and a button to take you to your destination
4. After you have built your launchpad, select **Done**.

## Home launchpads

Home launchpads act as individual start pages, providing a customized experience when using Dynatrace, for focus and quick access to things people need most.

### Set home launchpads for user groups

To set home launchpads for user groups

1. Go to **Settings**.
2. Select **General**.
3. Select **Launcher** > **Home launchpad**.
4. Select  **Add home launchpad**.
5. Select a launchpad from the list.
6. Start typing to **Select a user group**, or select **Everyone** to change the start page for all users.
7. Select **Save**.

After setting a home launchpad, it will be indicated as the  **Home** launchpad and load as the start page when entering Dynatrace. Access to **Getting started with Dynatrace**, the default home launchpad, is retained on the launchpads overview page.

![Launchpads list](https://dt-cdn.net/images/launchpads-list-2208-f213920787.png)

### Set your personal home launchpad

To set your personal home launchpad

1. Select  **Browse all**.  
   The launchpads overview page opens.
2. Select the launchpad you want to switch to.
3. Select  >  **Set as Home**
4. The next time you sign in to Dynatrace, your home launchpad will be your new start page.

![Set as home](https://dt-cdn.net/images/set-as-home-2642-cfef19cf7b.png)

Setting a home launchpad for yourself will override any home launchpad set by your admin. Access to home launchpads set by your admin will be retained under **Suggested** on the lauchpads overview page.

Home launchpad priority

1. Your personal home launchpad, set as  **Home**
2. Home launchpad set by your admin with highest rank
3. Other home launchpads set by your admin with lower ranks and other groups you're member of
4. **Getting started with Dynatrace**, the default home launchpad

In case a home launchpad fails to load (for example, due to failing permissions), the next in line will be opened.

## Common actions for launchpads

Select  in a launchpad or the overview page. From there, you can:

* **Rename** a launchpad.
* **Make a copy** to start building a new launchpad based on an existing one.
* **Delete** a launchpad.
* **Download** a launchpad so you can move it between environments. See [Download and upload a launchpad](#move).
* **Add to Dock**.

## Customize your launchpad

To customize a launchpad, open the launchpad and select **Customize**.

* Hover over a component you want to customize and select  >  **Edit**. You can also simply select a component when in **Customize** mode.
* Hover over a component and select  to select and drag the component to a new position.

![Move launchpad component](https://dt-cdn.net/images/drag-1888-0f03edd34a.png)

### Add a launchpad icon

Adding an icon will help your team know which launchpad they're on and will make it easier to pick the right one from a list of launchpads.

![Upload launchpad icon](https://dt-cdn.net/images/launchpads-icon-upload-2442-75e4e4057e.png)

To add a launchpad icon

1. Select **Customize**
2. Select **Upload icon**
3. Select the image to use as this launchpad's icon.
4. Select **Save**

File size limits

* 1 MB for JPG, PNG, and WEBP images
* 10 KB for SVG images

## Download and upload a launchpad

To move a launchpad between environments

1. Select  >  **Download** to download the launchpad.
2. Go to the destination environment, select  **Launchpads** >  **Upload**, and upload the JSON file you downloaded in the previous step.

## Share launchpads

If you own a launchpad, you can share it with other users in your Dynatrace environment.

![Share launchpad](https://dt-cdn.net/images/share-2226-f40006e092.png)

For details on sharing Dynatrace documents (including launchpads), see [Share documents](/docs/discover-dynatrace/get-started/dynatrace-ui/share "Share Dynatrace documents (dashboards, notebooks, and launchpads) with other Dynatrace users in your company.").

## API for launchpads

The **Launcher** app uses the [document serviceï»¿](https://dt-url.net/x403ua9) API to persist launchpads as documents.

Documents are content-agnostic, but have common metadata: a unique identifier, a name, and a description.

To distinguish different types of documents, and to make them visible to the respective apps, they need the correct `type` document attribute, in this case: `launchpad`. This attribute can also be used to query the API as shown in the following example.

```
https://environment/platform/document/v1/documents?filter=type='launchpad'
```

### Access full document service documentation

To see the full API documentation for the documents service

1. Go to the [Document serviceï»¿](https://dt-url.net/x403ua9) page of the [Dynatrace Developerï»¿](https://developer.dynatrace.com/) site.
2. In the **Related links** section, select the **Swagger API** link.

   You may need to sign in to your Dynatrace environment.

# Share documents

# Share documents

* Latest Dynatrace
* 10-min read
* Updated on Jan 12, 2026

A Dynatrace document (dashboard, notebook, or launchpad) can be shared with other users in your Dynatrace environment.

## Who can share a document

When you create a document, you are the owner. You can share it and do everything else listed in the **Owner** column of the [Permissions](#document-share-permissions-table) table.

By default, only the document owner can share a document.

However, the owner of a dashboard, notebook, or launchpad can choose to allow everyone with **Can edit** permission for a document to also share the document.

1. Display the document (dashboard, notebook, or launchpad).
2. Select **Share**.
3. Select  (**Manage access**).
4. Turn on **Allow editors to share**.

Give it away

If you no longer want to own a document at all, you can [assign ownership to someone else](#change-owner) instead of just sharing it.

## Sharing options

If you have permission to share a document, you have the following sharing options. You can combine options.

* [Access for all (view-only)](#document-share-visible-all): let everyone in your Dynatrace environment view the document.

  + Easy to do: just turn on the **Visible to anyone in your environment (Read only)** switch.
  + Easy to undo: just turn it off again.
  + Best for publishing information that should be available to everyone.
  + No write access: this is view-only sharing.
  + No access granularity: when you turn this on, everyone in your Dynatrace environment can see your document.
* [Access per user or group](#document-share-access): specify Dynatrace users and groups that can view or edit the document.

  + Better for ongoing sharing, where you want certain people or groups to always have access to the document.
  + Better granularity over who has access to the documentâyou can add, change, and revoke access per user and user group.
  + You need to maintain a list of users and user groups that have access.
* [Access via shared link](#document-share-link): create links to your document that others can use to view or edit the document.

  + Better for *ad hoc* sharing. Just generate a URL (with [View or Edit permissions](#document-share-permissions-table)) and forward it to people who should access the document.
  + If you share a document link, recipients can share it with others.
    Caution

    - Be careful when using the **Share link** method of sharing documents.

      If you a share a document link with other people in your Dynatrace environment, link recipients could forward the link to others. No one outside your Dynatrace environment could use the link to access your document, of course, but anyone in your Dynatrace environment could use it, and they would have the same permissions (**Can edit** or **Can view**) that you selected when you created the link.

      The **Share access** method gives you tighter control (with a granularity down to the person) over who can view or edit your documents.
    - Be careful when using the **Allow editors to share** option, which allows anyone with **Can edit** permission to share your document with others.
  + If you need to revoke access for one person, you need to revoke access for everyone (disable the link you distributed) and then create and distribute a new link for people who should have access.

Note that you can use a combination of sharing options for the same document.
For example:

* Maintain a list of people or groups who need regular edit or view access to the document (collaboration and joint editing).
* Occasionally send out an early access link to a wider audience (people who only need to review the document).
* Enable view access for all when you have a publishable document that you want to share with everyone in your Dynatrace environment.

For details on document permission levels, see the [Permissions](#document-share-permissions-table) section.

### Access for all (view-only)

The simplest way to share your information with everyone in your Dynatrace environment is to give [Can view](#document-share-permissions-table) access to everyone in your Dynatrace environment.

1. Display the document (dashboard, notebook, or launchpad).
2. Select **Share**.

   If you don't see a **Share** option in the document, you don't have write permission for the document, so you can't access the share settings.
3. Select  (**Manage access**).
4. Turn on **Visible to anyone in your environment (Read only)**.

   Now everyone in your Dynatrace environment has [Can view](#document-share-permissions-table) permissions for your document.

   * To revoke this access, just turn off **Visible to anyone in your environment (Read only)**.
   * If you select [Remove all access](#document-remove-all-access), that includes turning off this switch.

### Access per user or group

If you use SCIM groups

Users in SCIM groups are not listed in the web UI for sharing a document (dashboard or notebook) to specific users or groups unless you add those users to local Dynatrace groups.

To share a document by creating a list of users and user groups with **Can view** or **Can edit** access

1. Display the document (dashboard, notebook, or launchpad).
2. Select **Share**.

   If you don't see a **Share** option in the document, you don't own the document, so you can't access the share settings.
3. In the  **Share access** section of the **Share document** window, specify one or more people and groups with whom you want to share the document, and select the permission level they should have (**Can view** or **Can edit**). Repeat this part of the procedure as many times as you need:

   1. Select **Add people or groups in your company**, and then find and select one or more people and groups with whom you want to share the document. You need to type at least three characters to get valid search results.
   2. Select the permission level (**Can view** or **Can edit**) that you want to give to the selected people and groups.
   3. Select **Share document**. This adds the selected people and groups to a list of people with whom you can share the document. It includes the permission level (**Can view** or **Can edit**) that was displayed when you selected **Share document**.

      Don't give **Can edit** access to people if you don't want them to change your copy of the document.

      For a list of what people can do with **Can view** and **Can edit** permission, see the [Permissions](#document-share-permissions-table) section below.

### Access via shared link

To share a document by generating and distributing links (URLs)

1. Display the document that you want to share.
2. Select **Share**.

   If you don't see a **Share** option in the document, you don't own the document, so you can't access the share settings.
3. In the  **Share link** section of the **Share document** window, select a permission level (**Can view** or **Can edit**) and then select **Create link**. This creates a URL (with the selected permission level) and copies it to your clipboard.
4. Paste the link to a company communication channel (email, for example) and send the link to Dynatrace users in your company with whom you want to share the document. Recipients will be able to use the link to open your document with the selected permission level.

## Manage access

To manage sharing permissions for your document

1. Display the document.
2. Select **Share**.

   If you don't see a **Share** option in the document, you don't own the document, so you can't access the share settings.
3. In the **Share document** window, select  (**Manage access**) in the upper-right corner.
4. In the **Manage access** window, review and change sharing options as needed.

   People and groups

   Link for editing

   Link for viewing

   The **People and groups** tab lists

   * The owner of the document. By default, this is the person who created the document, but you can [change the owner](#change-owner).
   * Every other person or group with **Can view** or **Can edit** access to the document (other than through any links you might have shared)

   For each entry other than the owner, you can select one of the following:

   * **Can view**
   * **Can edit**
   * **Remove**

   To add people or groups to the list, see the [Access per user or group](#document-share-access) section above.

   Anyone in your company with a link for editing can follow the link to your document and then view or edit it.

   * If you haven't made a link for editing, this tab is empty. Select **Create link** if you want to share such a link with others.
   * If you have made a link for editing, this tab displays the link.

     + To get a copy of the link that you can share with others in your company, select **Copy**.
     + To delete the link, select **Delete**. If you already shared the link with anyone, the link will no longer work.

   Anyone in your company with a link for viewing can follow the link to your document and view but not edit it.

   * If you haven't made a link for viewing, this tab is empty. Select **Create link** if you want to share such a link with others.
   * If you have made a link for viewing, this tab displays the link.

     + To get a copy of the link that you can share with others in your company, select **Copy**.
     + To delete the link, select **Delete**. If you already shared the link with anyone, the link will no longer work.

## Remove all access



Sometimes you need to quickly and easily remove all shared access to a document.

To revoke all sharing for your document

1. Display the document.
2. Select **Share**.

   If you don't see a **Share** option in the document, you don't own the document, so you can't access the share settings.
3. In the **Share document** window, select  in the upper-right corner.
4. In the **Manage access** window, select **Remove all access** and then confirm your choice.

After you remove all access, only you can view or edit your document.

* No other people have individual access
* Access is not granted to anyone through membership in any groups
* Previously shared **Can view** and **Can edit** links to your document no longer work
* If **Visible to anyone in your environment (Read only)** was turned on, now it's off

## Verify all access

After you change sharing settings, it's a good idea to verify them.

**Quick check**: the icon before the **Share** button at the top of your document indicates whether the document is already shared.

* = shared
* = not shared

If you just updated your share settings, you might need to refresh your document to display the correct icon.

If your document is shared, you can check to see who has access to it.

1. Display the document.
2. Select **Share**.
3. In the **Share document** window, select  (**Manage access**) in the upper-right corner.
4. Review the settings.

   * If **Visible to anyone in your environment (Read only)** is turned on, everyone in your Dynatrace environment can view the document.
   * If **Allow editors to share** is turned on, everyone with **Can edit** permission for the document can also share the document. If you turn this setting off, only the document owner can share the document.
   * Are the settings on the three tabs correct?

     + **People and groups**
     + **Link for editing**
     + **Link for viewing**

## Change owner

A Dynatrace documentâsuch as a dashboard, notebook, launchpad, or workflowâis initially owned by the user who created it. The document owner has full permissions for that document.

When you change the document owner, you immediately lose access to the document.

* Be sure you are ready to transfer ownership before you select this command.
* You can regain access to the document only if the new owner gives you permission.

If you think you might need to access the document again, make a duplicate of the document, transfer ownership of one of the duplicate documents, and retain ownership of the other until you're sure you don't need it anymore.

### Dashboards **Dashboards**

To change ownership of the currently displayed [dashboard](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/dashboards-and-notebooks/dashboards-new "Create interactive, customizable views to visualize, analyze, and share your observability data in real time.")

1. Open the  menu next to the dashboard name and select  **Change owner**.
2. Find and select a new owner, and then select  **Change owner**.

2. Filter the table for  **Owned by me** to list your dashboards.
3. For each dashboard whose ownership you want to change, open the  menu for that dashboard and select  **Change owner**.

### Notebooks **Notebooks**

To change ownership of the currently displayed [notebook](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/dashboards-and-notebooks/notebooks "Analyze, visualize, and share insights from your observability dataâall in one collaborative, customizable workspace.")

1. Open the  menu next to the notebook name and select  **Change owner**.
2. Find and select a new owner, and then select  **Change owner**.

To change ownership of multiple notebooks

1. In ![Notebooks](https://dt-cdn.net/images/notebooks-768-046137830a.webp "Notebooks") **Notebooks**, select ![Dashboards](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dashboards-512-b1f1e9690b.png "Dashboards") **Notebooks** in the upper-left corner to display the **Notebooks** table.
2. Filter the table for  **Owned by me** to list your notebooks.
3. For each notebook whose ownership you want to change, open the  menu for that notebook and select  **Change owner**.

### Launchpads

To change ownership of a [launchpad](/docs/discover-dynatrace/get-started/dynatrace-ui/launchpads "Build and manage custom start pages with launchpads.")

1. Go to **Launcher**. If a launchpad is displayed, select  **Browse all** in the upper-left corner to display a table of launchpads.
2. Filter the table for  **Owned by me** to list your launchpads.
3. For each launchpad whose ownership you want to change, open the  menu for that launchpad and select  **Change owner**.

## Permissions

When you create a document, you are the document owner and you can do anything listed in the **Owner** column of the permissions table below. All other people have **Can view** or **Can edit** permission as determined by the document owner.

* **Can view**: can do the limited set of read-only things listed in the **Can view** column.
* **Can edit**: can do almost anything the owner can do.
* **Owner**: has permission to do everything with the document, including share it, change the owner, and delete it.

Sharing exceptions

* Be careful when using the **Share link** method of sharing documents.

  If you a share a document link with other people in your Dynatrace environment, link recipients could forward the link to others. No one outside your Dynatrace environment could use the link to access your document, of course, but anyone in your Dynatrace environment could use it, and they would have the same permissions (**Can edit** or **Can view**) that you selected when you created the link.

  The **Share access** method gives you tighter control (with a granularity down to the person) over who can view or edit your documents.
* Be careful when using the **Allow editors to share** option, which allows anyone with **Can edit** permission to share your document with others.

# Filter field

# Filter field

* Latest Dynatrace
* Reference
* 6-min read
* Updated on Jan 07, 2026

The filter field is a powerful UI component that enables you to quickly narrow down results and find relevant information within Dynatrace apps. Use the filter field when you need to search by specific attributes (like service name or status), combine multiple conditions with logical operators, or filter JSON data using dot or bracket notation.

For complex queries beyond what the filter field offers, consider using [Dynatrace Query Language (DQL)](/docs/platform/grail/dynatrace-query-language "How to use Dynatrace Query Language.") in [![Notebooks](https://dt-cdn.net/images/notebooks-768-046137830a.webp "Notebooks") **Notebooks**](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/dashboards-and-notebooks/notebooks "Analyze, visualize, and share insights from your observability dataâall in one collaborative, customizable workspace.") instead.

## Anatomy

![Filter field component in the Dynatrace UI.](https://dt-cdn.net/images/ui-filter-field-2018-44c7241dc1.png)

1. **Filter statement**: Each gray section is one complete statement of a filter criteria.
2. **Key**: The first part of the filter statement is the filter key or category.
3. **Comparison operator**: Shows the type of comparison.
4. **Value**: The specific value that youâre looking for.
5. **Logical operator**: Connects multiple filter statements. `AND` will be used automatically unless you add `OR`.

## How to use filters

* To create a filter statement, simply start typing in the filter field. A dropdown with suggestions will immediately open.
* Depending on the implementation, you can apply the filter:

  + By making a change in the filter field (dynamic filtering)
  + By selecting **Apply** (batched filtering)
  + By using the keyboard shortcuts: Windows**Ctrl+Enter** or macOS**Cmd+Enter**
* To clear the entire filter field, select the `X` at the right side of the field.
* To remove an individual filter, hover over the filter statement and select the `X` for that statement.

### Use filter suggestions

To make things easier for you, filter field offers relevant suggestions as you type.

* Descriptions on the right side of the suggestion provide context.
* To apply a suggestion, select it from the list (click or tap), or use the up and down arrow keys to navigate the list and then press **Enter**.

## General syntax

* Use a space as the separator, or delimiter, between keys, comparison operators, values, and filter statements.
* For numbers, use a decimal point `.` as the decimal separator.
* For arrays, use an equals sign `key = value`.

Note

Some features may not be available due to performance or data source limitations. For example, filter field generally supports [wildcards](#wildcards) (indicated by an asterisk `*`) at either the beginning (ends-with) or end (starts-with) of a value. However, certain implementations, such as those based on the classic entity selector API, might not support the ends-with option.

### Search

* Use `* ~ searchterm` to search across all data.
* Multiple searches can be combined using `AND` or `OR`. For details, see [Logical operators](#filter-field-logical-operators). In the following example, the result includes all data with the terms `paymentError` or `timeout` in any field.

  `* ~Â paymentError OR * ~ timeout`
* Searches can be combined with filters using `AND`. For details, see [Logical operators](#filter-field-logical-operators). In the following example, the result includes all data from the `payment-service` with the term `paymentError` in any field.

  `service = payment-service AND * ~Â paymentError`

### Comparison operators

Comparison operators define how a key compares to a value. Here are the available comparison operators:

Filter syntax

Description

Example

`=`

equals

`key = value`

`!=`

doesn't equal

`key != value`

`<`

less than

`key < value`

`<=`

less than or equal to

`key <= value`

`>`

greater than

`key > value`

`>=`

greater than or equal to

`key >= value`

`= *`

is any value

`key = *`

`!= *`

isn't any value

`key != *`

`in`

matches one or more values in a list of values

`key in (value1, value2)`

`not in`

doesnât match any value in a list of values

`key not in (value1, value2)`

### Logical operators

The filter field supports the logical operators `AND` and `OR`. If you donât specify an operator, filter statements are automatically connected by an implicit `AND`, which is the default logical operator between any two expressions.

Filter syntax

Description

Example

`AND`

Both expressions must be true.

`key = value key2 = value`  
Alternative:  
`key = value AND key2 = value`

`OR`

Only one expression must be true.

`key = value OR key2 = value`

### Grouping filter statements

Use parentheses `()` to group filter statements logically. For example, `key = value OR (key2 = value key3 = value)`.

### Escaping values

Space, `*`, `,`, `(`, `)`, `!`, `<`, `>`, `=`, `"`, `$`, `:`, `[`, `]`, `\`, and `~` are special characters in the filter field. To use special characters as part of a key or a value, you need to escape them.

Escape option

Description

Example

Quotation marks `"`

Wrap the corresponding key or value in quotation marks. In the following example, the spaces between `Product` and `Name`, and between `Widget` and `A`, are escaped by wrapping the values in quotation marks.

`"Product Name" = "Widget A"`

Backslash `\`

Escape a single character with a backslash `\`. In the following example, the asterisk on the right end is escaped with a backslash. This means it isn't interpreted as a wildcard.

`key = openshift-service-serving-signer@1677006647\*`

If you want a backslash to appear in a value, it must itself be escaped.
For example, to get `path = C:\my\path` you need to write `path = C:\\my\\path`.

### Case sensitivity

String values are case-insensitive for all operators.

### Wildcards

A wildcard will match any character in a value. Wildcards are indicated by an asterisk `*`.

Wildcard syntax

Description

`key = *value`

ends with any `value`

`key = value*`

starts with any `value`

`key = *value*`

contains any `value`

When a value contains **special characters** such as spaces, you must escape the value to ensure that it is correctly interpreted. In such cases, wildcards can be used **outside or inside** the escaped value. See examples below:

Suppose you want to filter for a service named "Payment Service". You would write the filter like this:

`Name = "Payment Service"`

This ensures that the entire string "Payment Service" is treated as a single value, including the space between "Payment" and "Service".

If you want to use wildcards with a value that contains spaces, you can do it like this:

`Name = *"Payment Service"*`

Or like this:

`Name = "*Payment Service*"`

This filter will match any service name that contains "Payment Service" anywhere within the name.

Wildcards are not supported within the `in ()` operator. The `in ()` operator filters for exact matches and does not interpret `*` as a wildcard.
If you want to use `*` as a literal character, you need to escape it using a backslash `\`. For example, to match the string `/visit*/_settings`, use `key = "/visit\*/_settings"`.
For more details, see [Escaping values](#escaping-values) in filter expressions.

### Variables

Variables act as a placeholder and allow you to dynamically select the values you want to use. To reference a variable, start the value with a `$`. For example: `k8s.cluster.name = $cluster`.

#### Variables and wildcards

Use the wildcard character `*` to filter for data that starts with, ends with, or contains a variable's value. You can place the `*` before, after, or on both sides of a variable. The position of the `*` determines how the filter behaves. For more insights see [wildcards](#wildcards).

When using a variable like `$cluster`, the position of the `*` relative to the variable determines the matching behavior:

* **Ends with the variable value**

  + `k8s.cluster.name = *$cluster` matches any value that ends with the value of `$cluster`.
  + **Example:** If `$cluster` is *myClusterName*, this matches *prod-myClusterName*.
* **Starts with the variable value**

  + `k8s.cluster.name = $cluster*` matches any value that starts with the value of `$cluster`.
  + **Example:** Matches *myClusterName-east*.
* **Contains the variable value**

  + `k8s.cluster.name = *$cluster*` matches any value that contains the value of `$cluster` anywhere within the string.
  + **Example:** Matches *prod-myClusterName-east*.

* [Variables in segments](/docs/manage/segments/concepts/segments-concepts-variables "Learn how variables help to form dynamic segments and reduce configuration effort and maintenance.")

### Filtering JSON data

Access nested fields in JSON data with dot or bracket notation. JSON filters may use a combination of dot and bracket notations.

Notation

Description

Example

Dot notation
`key$.field`

Use the compact dot notation for simple syntax.

`content$.uri = "/status-service/deployments/health"`

Bracket notation
`key$["field"][index]`

Use bracket notation for subkeys with special characters (spaces, dashes, etc.) and to access a child of an array.

`content$["spans"][0]["duration-ms"] > 75`

# What is a monitoring environment?

# What is a monitoring environment?

* Latest Dynatrace
* 4-min read
* Published Dec 05, 2017

Your Dynatrace monitoring environment is where all your Dynatrace performance analysis takes place. [Dynatrace OneAgent](/docs/platform/oneagent "Learn the monitoring capabilities of OneAgent.") sends all captured monitoring data to your monitoring environment for analysis. A monitoring environment is analogous to an analysis server that provides all Dynatrace application-performance analysis functionality, including all dashboards, charts, reports and other tools.

![Dynatrace architecture](https://dt-cdn.net/images/dynatrace-architecture-1743-fab92236e8.png)

## Monitoring environment location

Your monitoring environment location depends on your deployment type.

| Deployment type | Monitoring environment location |
| --- | --- |
| Standard SaaS | In the Dynatrace cloud |
| On-premises | In your own data center |
| Dynatrace for Government | In the cloud with FedRAMP moderate authorization |

## Environment ID

All external access to your Dynatrace monitoring environment relies on two credential types: an *environment ID* and an [access token](/docs/manage/identity-access-management/access-tokens-and-oauth-clients/access-tokens "Learn the concept of an access token and its scopes.").

Each environment that you monitor with Dynatrace is identified with a unique character stringâthe environment ID. The Dynatrace API relies heavily on environment IDs to ensure that it pulls monitoring data from and pushes relevant external events to the correct Dynatrace environments.

* In Dynatrace SaaS, your environment ID is the first part of your Dynatrace environment's URL:

  ```
  https://{your-environment-id}.live.dynatrace.com/
  ```

  For example, for the Dynatrace environment `https://abc123a.dynatrace.com`, the environment ID is `abc123a`.

  You can also find your environment ID in [Account Management](/docs/manage/account-management "Manage your Dynatrace license, subscriptions, and platform adoption and environment health.").

  1. Go to [**Account Management**ï»¿](https://myaccount.dynatrace.com/). If you have more than one account, select the account you want to manage.
  2. Select **Settings** > **Environments**.

     You can find the environment ID in the **Environment** column.

For example, for the URL address `https://managed-cluster/e/abc123a`, the environment ID is `abc123a`.

## Multiple monitoring environments

You can set up and monitor separate Dynatrace monitoring environments with a single Dynatrace account.

When you set up multiple monitoring environments:

* Each monitoring environment shares the same user base and other account settings.
* The data collected from each monitoring environment is kept separate.
* It's easy to switch between monitoring views for separate environments to track the performance and availability of each environment.

### Use cases

There are several reasons people choose to create separate monitoring environments.

For example:

* You may want to monitor your organization's development, staging, and production environments separately.
* You may want to maintain a separate monitoring environment for each of your organization's data centers.

### Set up multiple monitoring environments

How you set up different monitoring environments depends on whether you use Dynatrace SaaS, Dynatrace Managed, or Dynatrace for Government.

| Deployment type | How set up different monitoring environments |
| --- | --- |
| SaaS | Contact a Dynatrace product expert via live chat within your Dynatrace environment; the product expert will make sure you get the assistance you need. |
| Managed | You can use the Cluster Management Console. For details, see [Managed - managed-monitoring-environmentï»¿](https://docs.dynatrace.com/managed/shortlink/managed-monitoring-environment). |
| Dynatrace for Government | Contact your Dynatrace representative. |

### Connect my multiple environments

With multiple environments, monitoring data is strictly separated by design. Environments do not automatically receive information one from another.

In some scenarios, however, you might need to connect your environments. For example:

* To trace calls between services monitored in different Dynatrace environments, you can configure cross-environment tracing. For details, see [Set up cross-environment tracing](/docs/observe/application-observability/distributed-traces/analysis/connect-environments "Analyze requests across environment boundaries.").
* To display metrics from remote environments on your local environment's dashboards, you can set up cross-environment dashboard tiles. For details, see [Create remote/multi-environment Dynatrace dashboards](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/dashboards-classic/dashboards/dashboards-multi-environment "Create dashboards that display data from multiple Dynatrace environments.").

# Platform Engineering

# Platform Engineering

* Latest Dynatrace
* 24-min read
* Published Jan 18, 2024

Gartner[1](#fn-1-1-def) predicts that by 2026, 80% of large software engineering organizations will establish platform engineering teams as internal providers of reusable services, components, and tools for application delivery, up from 45% in 2022.

## What is platform engineering?

Platform engineering is a modern, core engineering discipline that has emerged to accelerate the development and deployment of software that is resilient and effective at scale.

The goal is to operationalize DevSecOps and SRE practices by providing an internal self-service platform with development workspace templates to reduce the cognitive load on engineering teams and provide fast development feedback cycles out of the box.

An internal developer platform (IDP) encompasses a set of tools, services, and infrastructure that enables developers to build, test, and deploy software applications. These platforms are tailored specifically to an organization's needs, demands, and goals.

Through the development, deployment, and maintenance of these IDPs, platform engineering teams deliver:

* Increased innovation and development speed
* Better developer experience
* Higher developer productivity
* Reduced infrastructure costs
* And more

IDPs allow teams to shift more of their time and effort to delivering best-in-class products to their end customers.

## Effective IDPs

The majority of IDPs are containerized and built on top of Kubernetes-centric infrastructure with a core set of technologies. The diagram below maps out what a basic IDP should include.

Features of a strong and effective IDP:

Crucial capabilities of an IDP are provided as self-service to development teams. Some of these self-service capabilities might include:

* Platform services (service mesh, data storage, security vaults, policy agents)
* Delivery services (continuous integration, continuous delivery, Git, GitOps)
* Observability services for monitoring, automation, and security
* Templates for development workspaces including all the above

Platform engineering also offers the ability to:

* Automate key workflows like validation
* Achieve optimal performance and security
* Ensure the platform is working as expected and resources are being used in an optimal manner

Source: [https://tag-app-delivery.cncf.io/whitepapers/platforms/ï»¿](https://tag-app-delivery.cncf.io/whitepapers/platforms/#capabilities-of-platforms)

## Treat your platform as a product

A key aspect of platform engineering is approaching your platform with a product management mentality. Every aspect should be meticulously designed and optimized for the benefit of the user: the developer.

### Looking at an IDP with a product management lens

* **The product**: An internal development platform (IDP) built to provide self-service for infrastructure, services, and support for the development teams as they build, test, and deploy applications at scale
* **The customer**: Development teams who want to accelerate the production of high-quality, resilient apps â with low effort for onboarding for new applications and new developers

## Maturing DevOps with platform engineering

**You build it, you run it doesnât scale anymore.**

DevOps alone doesnât meet the demands of cloud-native software development. Platform engineering is DevOps applied at cloud-native scale.

Effective DevOps supports cross-functional cooperation and boosts efficiency. Platform engineering builds on traditional DevOps practices but goes a step further.

By providing a framework and techstack to apply DevOps principles at scale with Kubernetes-centric infrastructure, platform engineering allows organizations to realize many of the benefits DevOps promised to deliver.

In practice, maturing DevOps into platform engineering involves providing centrally maintained development tooling, templates for CI/CD toolchains, processes, and application lifecycle orchestration solutions via a unified platform that development teams can use for greater efficiency. It enables a frictionless developer experience with minimum overhead, reducing cognitive load and providing fast feedback out of the box.

Platform engineeringâs standardized processes and technologies across development and operations teams lead to significant gains in developer productivity and improvements in developer experience.

Additionally, the platform engineering approach allows organizations to take advantage of economies of scale, consolidating sprawling tech stacks to:

* Manage cost
* Optimize resource usage
* Improve governance

### Cloud-native platforms require a new approach to observability

To be broadly adopted by internal development teams and deliver on its promise of unlocking DevSecOps at scale, a Kubernetes-centric IDP requires other services and components to tackle challenges related to:

* Visibility
* Resource utilization
* Security
* Orchestration
* Collaboration

Top engineering teams unlock faster deployments and fewer errors by empowering developers to manage their own deployments. Enabling self-service requires developers to be able to debug code quickly, which isnât easy in complex environments. Observability makes all the difference.

Observability isnât just about the user-facing application. Effective platform engineeringâas DevOps at cloud-native scaleâenables self-service for developers or development teams, and that self-service often requires automation in the background. To provide guard rails and make the system governable, it must be observable.

When implemented properly, platform engineering brings end-to-end observability to the full software development lifecycle, from development to release, to operation, and eventually to retirement.

### Implementation

Fortunately, organizations donât have to replace every tool, vendor, and practice to implement platform engineering. DevOps and cloud-native processes often continue managing systems and pipelines and working on automation and self-service.

### Benefits

#### Accelerate development and support developer productivity

More than two-thirds of all organizations (68%) implementing platform engineering have already realized an increase in development velocity.

Organizations with platform engineering teams see various benefits to their speed and efficiency. They report a variety of benefits, notably:

1. Improved system reliability
2. Improved efficiency and productivity of work
3. Faster delivery time

#### Improve developer experience

A best-in-class developer experience gives your organization a strategic
advantage.

* Reduces the cognitive load of the developer
* Reduces overall burden on the operations team
* Improves quality of services from internal IT operations resources, processes, and practices
* Provides a more efficient path for product delivery
* Provides fast feedback cycles to developers

#### Optimize resources and mitigate cost

With a shared pool of resources for all projects, standardized practices, and the power of AI, platform engineering optimizes resource usage, leverages economies of scales, and mitigates cost.

#### Standardize tech stack to minimize risk and increase governance

Effective platform engineering enables teams to keep complexity low, standardize delivery, and still allow for autonomy and freedom.

* Security and compliance are built in by design of the platform components and services.
* Golden Path templates standardize delivery â providing governance.
* Identification and remediation of issues or misconfigurations across templatized and standardized services becomes quick and easy.

## The minimum viable platform: BACK stack + observability

If you were to start from scratch, only with a Git and CI tool in place, a simple beginning could be to work with the BACK stack:

Backstage
:   [Graphical user interface (web portal)ï»¿](https://backstage.io/)

Argo
:   [Delivery of artifactsï»¿](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

Crossplane
:   [APIs and CLIs for configuration automationï»¿](https://www.crossplane.io/)

Kyverno
:   [Scan artifacts and enforce policiesï»¿](https://kyverno.io/)

The BACK stack includes the artifact delivery and security as well as the configuration and developer portal, but thatâs not all it takes. Observing the workloads is equally important and must be included in a minimum viable platform.

To feed the observability and security data back to the developers, we offer a [Backstage integration](/docs/deliver/backstage-integration "Learn how to integrate Dynatrace into Backstage") with Kubernetes support by default and customizable queries.

OpenTelemetry offers open-source observability, and Dynatrace can be used for observability either out of the box with our proprietary OneAgent or by easily ingesting and using the data provided through OpenTelemetry.

## Core platform observability and security principles

Kubernetes is a good starting point for building a platform, allowing platform engineering teams to provide self-service capabilities and features to their DevSecOps teams. However, it also introduces complexity to the cloud environment.

Organizations need the automatic answers and insights that observability and security analytics provide to manage and overcome the complexity introduced by todayâs business needs and complex multi-cloud-native environments.

Follow these core principles when building your Internal Developer Platform (IDP) to manage an application or service throughout its Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

### 1. Core platform observability



A critical first step in achieving actionable platform insights is
ensuring monitoring of the artifact (service or application) as well as
the full software development lifecycle and the underlying IDP:

* **Artifact**: How does my product behave in various environments (staging, testing, production)?
* **Platform Toolstack**: What is the health and utilization of the tools in use (e.g. BACK stack)?

Treating (critical) platform services like any other business-critical service allows for easy and effective incident triage, issue resolution, and improved developer experience.

#### Some aspects of core platform observability

* **Ensuring resiliency, availability, and security** by applying the same practices to all platform services
* **Optimizing usage, performance, and licensing** to positively impact the application lifecycle and reduce cost
* **Detecting misconfiguration or misuse** by discovering upcoming problems and issues, used to educate users.

### 2. Release information

Attaching the current version and stage information to services allows for easy triaging and resolution of issues. This can be done by promoting the version and stage information to Kubernetes containers as environment variables or annotations.

### 3. Pipeline efficiency

While the platform tool stack monitoring outlined in the previous paragraph covers the health of the IDP, it does not yet cover the efficiency of the pipeline. This is where logs, events, and telemetry data from pipeline or workflow executions come in.

By analyzing pipeline or workflow logs, events, and traces, itâs possible to create metrics (for example, DORA metrics) that can be used for benchmarking and deciding where to invest time or resources for improvement.

Most used tools in a cloud-native environment already emit events or telemetry data, but this area currently lacks dedicated standards and semantic conventions.

### 4. Ownership information

When looking at artifacts, responsibility is a critical piece of information. Who is responsible for an application or service in production, and who owns security?

This was often maintained in CMDBs, Excel sheets, or active directories. However, it's wise to manage this information proactively and automatically in cloud-native environments with constant updates and changes.

One way to do this is through Kubernetes labels and annotations, ensuring out-of-the-box availability of this critical information across the lifecycle.

### 5. AI Observability

With the rise of generative AI in DevOps Portals and IDP tools, providing observability for these systems is growing to efficiently drive the experience they provide while keeping costs in check.

## Platform Engineering use cases

With effective platform engineering, everything is available in self-service through Golden Paths (templates). Self-service provides autonomy for rapid, secure innovation while maintaining guard rails for consistency and enabling governance.

We have categorized use cases with a product-lifecycle-centric view, rather than a platform-centric view, to emphasize the ease of adoption of use cases for platform engineering teams and cases in which no formal platform engineering team has been established.

**Develop - Release - Operate - Predict - Prevent - Resolve - Protect - Improve**

All of the following use cases are available to the platform engineering team to make their work observable and easier, or for the platform engineering team to provide automation and self-service capabilities to their usersâthe development teams.

### Develop

This category contains all activities around planning, developing, building, and testing services and applications on an Internal Developer Platform (IDP) provided by a platform engineering team.

#### Test pipeline observability Test pipeline observability

Goal
:   From millions of test events to a single source of truth.

Provide observability into test results automatically across different used tools and ensure all test results are available in a single source of truth.

* Increase efficiency and insights through test observability
* Ingest test events and metadata into a single unified observability platform
* Visualize test results and KPIs in one central view or dashboard
* Identify long lasting tests to easily optimize for faster test feedback

Try it yourself: [Test pipeline observability](/docs/deliver/test-pipeline-observability "Utilize Dynatrace to observe and analyze test pipelines effectively").

#### Continuous testing validation Continuous testing validation

Goal
:   120X reduction in evaluation times from days to minutes.

Testing is often highly automated already, but teams still frequently test in siloes.

To ensure high quality customer experience automatically and proactively:

* Combine, continuously evaluate, and baseline test results from testing tools
* Incorporate SLOs, security findings and synthetic tests
* Reduce the number of manual operations by engineers to verify quality of new release
* Easily integrate CI/CD delivery pipeline with tools like Dynatrace Synthetic Monitoring to ensure that new releases where all critical user journeys work as expected

#### Observability-driven development Observability-driven development

Goal
:   Mean Time to Observability reduction from hours to seconds.

In the previous section, we outlined the importance of covering ownership and release information early in the lifecycle by extending the provided metadata to include observability and security rules, SLOs, and even automation and remediation steps.

Standardizing these based on technology, team, or criticality of service enables the use of simple as-code templates as Golden Paths, ensuring consistency and governance across the lifecycle.

Standardizing across teams can:

* Bring observability and transparency to development teams out-of-the-box
* Provide real-time insights into what's happening
* Conduct observability and reliability checks at an early stage to enable faster reaction to potential issues before they reach production
* Increase accountability of application teams and empower them to get early insights in their implementations
* Provide autonomy while having consistent rules for the same criticality of service

### Release

This category contains all activities around releasing and deploying in environments along the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

#### Continuous testing validation Release validation

Goal
:   Reduce change failure rate and reduce production deployment lead time by up to 99%

Automatically validate new releases â taking downstream and upstream dependencies into account â based on baselining, observability data, SLOs, and security information. Use the results to drive meaningful follow-up actions. Providing release validation templates as part of every delivery process enables fast feedback regarding any negative side-effects of a new version. Faster feedback leads to better developer experience, higher release quality, and higher innovation pace.

Try it yourself: [Release validation](/docs/deliver/quality-gates "Validate the releases of your business-critical services").

#### Progressive delivery Progressive delivery

Goal
:   90-99% reduced problem exposure with progressive delivery.

Releasing updates and new versions of an application or service in a gradual and controlled manner can help teams provide fast, secure, and high-quality services without disrupting business.

Based on the observability data, including SLO trends and synthetic checks, an automated progressive delivery release like canary or blue/green can be established.

* Automated workflow execution to control the software delivery
* Direct Kubernetes interactions to apply configuration changes
* Governance for the delivery process by leveraging events
* Targeted notifications to inform the team in charge of the delivery process

#### Pipeline observability Pipeline observability

Goal
:   100% real-time standardized coverage of your software lifecycle health.

People often say, you canât manage what you canât measure. The statement holds true for the software development lifecycle as well. To calculate critical metrics, such as lead time for change, it's
important to take note of the pipeline telemetry data.

Using pipeline observability, the data (for example failed builds, lead time) can be calculated and acted upon automatically. With automated data, these metricsâlike the DORA metrics lead time for change, deployment frequency, change failure rate, and mean time to resolveâare readily available in several dimensions, including application/service, platform service/pipeline, and technology and
ownership.

In addition to metrics, logs and traces of pipeline runs can help debug erroneous pipelines or identify time-consuming hotspots that can be optimized for more efficient pipelines.

### Operate



This category contains activities around monitoring and operating services and applications in production environments.

#### Data-driven cloud tuning Cloud cost optimization

Goal
:   Reduce cross-zone network traffic by up to 55%.

By combining network data with infrastructure and billing information, top cost contributors can be identified and analyzed, leading to improvements by pinpointed adoption of network compression or other hyperscaler tools.

Try it yourself: [Data-driven cloud tuning](/docs/observe/infrastructure-observability/cloud-platform-monitoring/use-cases/cloud-costs "Manage your cloud deployment using Grail and your cloud vendor-provided data in context.").

#### AI Observability Generative AI observability

Goal
:   Increase reliability while keeping costs from surging.

With the rise of generative AI in DevOps Portals and IDP tools, tracking usage and consumption is becoming increasingly important, allowing streamlined access and managing cost effectively.

Using observability data further allows the proper sizing and configuration of generative AI tools, increasing experience and productivity for development teams.

Try it yourself:

* [AI and LLM Observability](/docs/observe/dynatrace-for-ai-observability "Learn about AI and LLM observability, what AI observability is, how Dynatrace observes Generative AI (LLM) models and AI SaaS services, and much more.")

#### Infrastructure observability Observability for infrastructure

Goal
:   30% reduced MTTR by breaking down data silos.

For IT operations teams, the central challenge in ensuring the health of the IT infrastructure lies in the daunting task of pinpointing the exact root cause of issues.

By applying Golden Paths and as-code templates, users can quickly trace performance issues to their source by "following the red" to the problematic infrastructure entity. This approach allows an immediate understanding of how entities such as hosts, processes, and their associated relationships contribute to the identified issue.

#### Kubernetes monitoring

Goal
:   Manage your platform with 30+ out-of-the-box health alerts.

Establishing scalable cluster lifecycle management within a diverse multi-cluster environment featuring various distributions requires a centralized repository with a single source of truth.

This centralized view:

* Serves as the hub for ingesting, visualizing, and analyzing telemetry data from different layers of the Kubernetes stack
* Enables the execution of configuration actions based on observability insights, such as resource consumption and performance management across all clusters
* Offers extended centralized monitoring and alerting capabilities, particularly for node failure incidents

### Predict

Many incidents that used to result in wake-up calls for people on standby can now be addressed before they become major issues by using predictive AI and forecasting.

#### Predictive operations Predictive Kubernetes operations

Goal
:   Reduce overprovisioning and storage needs by up to 75%.

Within cloud-native environments, resizing disks can happen frequently. Predictive AI for forecasting enables automatic and timely resizing of disks, avoiding system outages while keeping costs low.

Try it yourself: [Predictive Kubernetes operations](/docs/observe/infrastructure-observability/kubernetes-app/use-cases/predictive-operations "Proactively manage disk space within Kubernetes environments").

#### Forecasting in data analytics Forecasting in data analytics

Goal
:   Zero disk-resize related after-hour alerts for SREs.

Anticipatory management of cloud resources within highly dynamic IT systems is a critical success factor for modern companies. Operators must closely observe business-critical resources such as storage, CPU, and memory to avoid resource-driven outages.

#### Forecasting in workflows Forecasting in workflow automation

Goal
:   Reduce up to 100% of recurring manual efforts with prediction-driven automation.

Predictive AI in workflow automation makes it possible to proactively raise tickets and act automatically before problems arise.

Try it yourself: [AI in Workflows - Predictive maintenance of cloud disks](/docs/dynatrace-intelligence/use-cases/davis-for-workflows "Automate predictive maintenance of cloud resources with Dynatrace Intelligence within AutomationEngine.").

### Prevent

Even when AI canât predict issues, it can often prevent them using observability and security data.

#### Bug prevention Preventing customer-facing bugs

Goal
:   Reduce end-user-facing bugs by up to 36%.

Ingesting and automatically analyzing application log data from production makes it easy to issue tickets with context and create and assign work to the respective development teams, allowing them to act and resolve bugs before end-users encounter them.

Try it yourself: [Automated bug triaging and ticketing](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/logs/lma-use-cases/lma-e2e-resolve-dependencies "Explore a Log Management and Analytics use case for resolving team dependencies.").

#### Unified exposure protection Unified exposure protection

Goal
:   Cut risk remediation from 96 hours to 4 hours â 95% faster.

Observability and security are converging to facilitate prioritization and risk assessment of security findings, resolving the most common frustration with existing tools, specifically during the software development stages. Combining this with automation leads to effective engagements with the teams who need to act on those security findings.

#### Continuous security posture awareness Continuous security posture awareness

Goal
:   Instant live security reports.

Get a unified and prioritized view of different exposures across your different application tiers and your production and pre-production environments.

* Prioritize vulnerabilities with a custom risk specific to your organization
* Learn what remediation activities prioritize for impactâand let automation handle it
* Learn the details of a vulnerability, such as which entities are impacted and whether thereâs any link to databases.

### Resolve

Once an incident occurs, it's important to take the right steps immediately. Sometimes, the first step is to inform the right team with the required information. At other times, issues can be remediated and resolved automatically.

#### Incident auto-routing Incident triaging and response

Goal
:   Improve MTTR by up to 99%.

Using observability and security data combined with context and further metadata (such as ownership information), it becomes easy to automatically triage issues as they arise and follow through with the
proper response.

The proper response could be any automated action available, such as informing stakeholders through communication tools, opening incident tickets, triggering configuration management tools, or remediating directly by executing Kubernetes jobs or creating pull requests.

#### Business impact Resolving critical business impact

Goal
:   Linking IT alerts to business impact provides prioritization.

Combining IDP observability data with the impact an IDP has on business transactions and footprints allows organizations to prioritize based on the highest-impact issues first.

#### Error budget alerting Error budget alerting

Goal
:   Increase triaging efficiency by 90%.

If you have 99 problems, how do you prioritize?

An easy way to focus on the right problems is to look at those actively impacting Service-Level Objectives (SLOs). If the number of issues in an environment still calls for further prioritization, automatically triage and inform stakeholders easily by alerting them on the SLO error budget burn rate (how fast the SLO error budget is consumed).

### Protect



All environments, infrastructures, and applications must be protected â with the right measures. Organizations can protect their assets more easily with a consistent Internal Developer Platform (IDP), providing governance and security.

#### Security alert noise reduction Security Operations Center (SOC) noise reduction

Goal
:   Reduce security event storms by 99%

Avoiding fatigue due to the myriad of security events emitted by hyperscaler tools every single day by deduplication and consolidation combined with automatic ticket creation and assignment based on development and security ownership.

Try it yourself: [CSPM Notification Automation](/docs/secure/use-cases/notification-automation "Improve cloud security posture by automatically processing, triaging, enriching, and classifying incoming security alerts.").

#### Security as a service Automate security findings at scale

Goal
:   Strive towards zero false positives.

Understand the threat posed by your code, third party, and open-source libraries and block malicious requests attempting to exploit code weaknesses in these.

* Precisely detect & block attacks
* While applications keep serving their users
* Integrated with OneAgent & available at the flip of a switch

#### Continuous security posture awareness Contextualized threat detection and incident response

Goal
:   From threat hypothesis to tangible evidence in minutes.

Today, security takes everyone in your organization, and all your data is relevant for security. That's why it needs to be easy to ingest any data and have it available for manual detailed security analytics. At the pace of cybersecurity attacks today, there is no way around automation. By the time your valuable security analysts get in front of an incident or investigate a malicious pattern - you want to ensure it's worth their time. With data contextualization, workflow actions, and dedicated security analytics apps, you have all the tools to be proactive about security. Finding whether you have a bad actor in your system, what they are up to, and preventing them from being successful â with the merge of observability and security, it's easy to understand how to elevate your analysts by leveling up the security incident first, fully contextualizing the incident, and prioritizing based on
importance.

* Stop attackers in their tracks
* Leverage observability and security data in context to see every detail of your environment
* All the data is consolidated at your fingertips
* Automation actions easily combined into a workflow elevate your analysts whenever they need to look at an incident

### Improve

Continuous improvement of resources drives business. These improvements can range from cost- to time-savings to always ensuring best-in-class customer experiences.

#### Always-on app profiling Always-on app profiling

Goal
:   5x faster performance bottleneck issue resolution

With observability data around CPU, thread, and memory usage, it's easy to quickly identify the biggest performance bottlenecks and flag them for improvement. Such bottlenecks could manifest themselves as inefficient string operations leading to high memory allocation and pressure on the garbage collector, which can, in turn, lead to scalability and performance issues.

Try it yourself: [Always-on app profiling](/docs/observe/application-observability/services/always-on-app-profiling "Optimize your code and find performance problems").

#### Kubernetes utilization improvement Kubernetes utilization improvement

Goal
:   Automated K8s utilization improvement reduces spend up to 25%.

Continuously update and improve k8s requests and limits automatically, reducing cognitive load on developers and providing peace of mind for platform engineers.

By analyzing Kubernetes metrics and SLOs for resource allocation and utilization, it's possible to set environment configuration avoiding any misalignment.

#### Business alignment Business alignment

Goal
:   Bring in context to your business processes and accelerate collaboration.

It's critical to align platform engineering initiatives and work with the primary value stream. Aligning initiatives to assets allows for easier prioritization of improvement work and communication with the line of business.

## Measuring platform success

### Governance and consistency at scale

Golden Paths guide developers, saving time and reducing risks. But they're not one-size-fits-all â flexibility exists for individual customization and exploration.

The result? A platform that scales effortlessly, where standardized efficiency works with developer autonomy to offer governance and consistency.

Applying product management principles and observability to the IDP makes it possible to provide meaningful insights into platform infrastructure, tools, and services. Golden Paths adoption and efficiency regarding feedback for developers.

### DORA metrics

Googleâs DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) team established the DORA metrics to provide key metrics on the performance of a software development team.

The established four keys include:

Deployment frequency
:   Measures how often a team successfully releases to production

Lead time for change
:   Measures the time it takes for committed code to get into production.

Change failure rate
:   Measures the percentage of deployments that result in a failure in production that requires a bug fix or roll-back.

Mean time to restore service (MTTR)
:   Measures how long it takes an organization to recover from a failure in production.

The DORA team extended these metrics by adding a fifth one in 2021:

Reliability
:   Representing availability, latency, performance, and scalability

Benchmarking in real-time and across dimensions (such as technologies and teams) provides crucial benefits or a platform engineering team.

### Developer experience

Platform engineering is ultimately about driving developer productivity. But how do you define and measure developer productivity and satisfaction? It canât be reduced to a single metric, but the SPACE framework captures critical dimensions of developer productivity:

* Satisfaction
* Performance
* Activity
* Communication and collaboration
* Efficiency and flow

The SPACE framework doesn't provide a ready-to-use list of metrics like the DORA metrics, but instead guides in providing categories to consider.

## Dynatrace and OpenTelemetry

[OpenTelemetry](/docs/ingest-from/opentelemetry "Learn how to integrate and ingest OpenTelemetry data (traces, metrics, and logs) into Dynatrace.") (also referred to as OTel) is an open-source observability framework made up of a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs.

* OTel enables IT teams to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data for analysis and understanding software performance and behavior.

  As a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) incubating project, OTel aims to provide unified sets of vendor-agnostic libraries and APIs, mainly for collecting data and transferring it somewhere.
* Dynatrace, which is committed to making observability seamless for technical teams, is the only observability solution that combines high-fidelity distributed tracing, code-level visibility, and advanced diagnostics across cloud-native architectures. Data plus context are critical to supercharging observability.

  By integrating OTel data seamlessly, Dynatraceâs distributed tracing technology automatically picks up OTel data and provides the instrumentation for all the essential frameworks beyond the scope of OTel.

# Serverless monitoring

# Serverless monitoring

* Latest Dynatrace
* 3-min read
* Updated on Jan 28, 2026

The term **serverless** defines the cloud services that share common characteristics:

* Heavily abstracted and **not requiring the management of underlying infrastructure**
* Highly available and **scaling elastically** with your needs
* Billed on a **pay-per-use** (consumption) model

While often used as a synonym for Functions-As-A-Service (FaaS), serverless cloud services span all sorts of services. The three most important categories are:

* **Serverless compute**, including functions and containers, as well as managed Kubernetes
* **Serverless PaaS** such as API gateways, messaging systems, or queues
* **Serverless databases** and caches

## Observability challenges

The nature of serverless technologies creates some challenges for the effective observability of such cloud services:

* Heavily distributed, which makes distributed tracing a critical capability.
* Sandboxed environments, with limited capabilities to modify.
* Many different ways to capture telemetry.
* Limitations of cloud provider native monitoring services

  + Gaining an understanding of system behavior can be difficult, as telemetry is provided from many data sources and spread across multiple places.
  + Obtaining an end-to-end view can be difficult, especially when using hybrid or multi-cloud and third-party applications.
  + Limited capabilities, missing critical capabilities such as real user monitoring, or profiling requiring additional tools.
* New problem patterns:

  + Cold start behavior
  + Cloud service provisioning optimizations
  + Complex service limits and quotas
  + Transient faults

## Serverless observability with Dynatrace

Through integrations with the three major public cloud service providers, Dynatrace is able to unify metric, metadata, event, log, and trace data, providing data-in-context and end-to-end visibility, while the power of Dynatrace Intelligence makes analysis of this data possible.

![Unified serverless telemetry](https://dt-cdn.net/images/unified-service-descr-630-f2484fd514.png)

With over [600+ integrations, extensions, and technology-specific supportï»¿](https://www.dynatrace.com/hub/), Dynatrace provides extensive monitoring support, including your [serverless technologies](/docs/ingest-from/technology-support/serverless-compute-services "Learn which features and capabilities Dynatrace supports for serverless compute services for functions (FaaS).") running on AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

## Getting started with serverless monitoring

[![Step 1](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-1-086e22066c.svg "Step 1")

**Turn on cloud service monitoring**](/docs/discover-dynatrace/get-started/serverless-monitoring#services "Serverless observability with Dynatrace")[![Step 2](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-2-1a1384627e.svg "Step 2")

**Enable Dynatrace extensions on cloud services**](/docs/discover-dynatrace/get-started/serverless-monitoring#extensions "Serverless observability with Dynatrace")[![Step 3](https://dt-cdn.net/images/step-3-350cf6c19a.svg "Step 3")

# Get started with Dynatrace

# Get started with Dynatrace

* Latest Dynatrace
* How-to guide
* 3-min read
