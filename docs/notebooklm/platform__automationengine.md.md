Dynatrace AutomationEngine enables you to combine observability, security, and business data with causal AI to easily automate BizDevSecOps workflows at enterprise scale.

## Use cases

Extending the Dynatrace platform natively with AutomationEngine leads to causal-AI-powered, answer-driven automation. This helps organizations to achieve proactive prevention, efficient operation, faster remediation, strong protection, and business acceleration.

Use cases include:

* **Targeted notification and collaboration**: Connect the right teams and equip them with answers in real time.
* **Closed-loop remediation**: Automatically remediate problems and vulnerabilities.
* **Quality and security gating**: Block vulnerabilities and regressions before they reach production.
* **Continuous vulnerability assessment**: Detect zero-day vulnerabilities.
* **Predictive automation**: Take maintenance measures before risking a potential failure.
* **Progressive delivery orchestration**: Orchestrate releases based on user and system feedback.
* **Intelligent infrastructure and application orchestration**: Auto-scale and resize smarter load distributions.
* **Preventive security configurations**: Block malicious IPs based on known attack patterns.
* **Predictive capacity management**: Forecast capacity shortages to avoid resource related outages.

AutomationEngine is not intended for mass data ingestion or mass data export. For large-scale data processing, consider using [OpenPipeline](/docs/platform/openpipeline "Scale Dynatrace platform data handling with Dynatrace OpenPipeline.") or building custom solutions with [Dynatrace Extensions](/docs/ingest-from/extensions "Learn how to create and manage Dynatrace Extensions.").

[Dynatrace Workflows](/docs/analyze-explore-automate/workflows "Automate IT processes with Dynatrace Workflowsâreact to events, schedule tasks, and connect services."), powered by AutomationEngine, puts automation use cases at your fingertips. Every automated workflow consists of easy configuration, extensive trigger options, out-of-the-box actions and integrations, and unprecedented extensibility by leveraging webhooks, JavaScript code, and application actions powered by [AppEngine](/docs/platform/appengine "Develop feature-rich Dynatrace apps for you and the world!").
